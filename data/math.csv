I love abstract mathematics, but I have the expectation that to really understand a topic, I need an intuitive understanding of it. Yet the more abstract the topics get, it gets harder and harder for me.
     
Is this normal? Does a good mathematician need to have an intuition for everything he does? By that I don't even mean a geometric interpretation, but just **some** sort of intuition so that I can for example get an idea of what properties hold for certain structures **before** I try to prove/disprove them.
For example, am I supposed to have an intuitive understanding of solvable and nilpotent groups beyond the pure abstract definitions? Or of rings that are not domains (i.e. they have nonzero divisors) or that are non euclidean?
When asked to prove theorems about objects, I mostly just try out stuff until works. Often I have no idea of **why** that theorem holds.       
      
I have been worrying about that for years. So I would love to hear your experiences with this problem. Do you have it? If so, hownare you handling it?",math

43.0,43.0,A Cool Result from Geometric Algebra,tickle-fickle,1627180672,"Hello math enthusiasts!

So I've been avoiding my responsibilities, and instead I was coding a lot, making a C# class of 3D multivectors. I was learning about the concepts from random youtube videos about geometric algebra and random pdf presentations from some GA lectures but there was this one problem that I didn't find a solution to. Namely, ""Given a multivector V, find a multivector V\^-1 such that VV\^-1 = V\^-1 V = 1."" The problem seemed pretty basic, but I found that either nobody gives a s\*\*t about it, or it's so basic that people solve it on the first day of GA and forget about it. But the solution I found is... pretty elegant actually, maybe not as elegant as I'd want it to be. Before I describe my solution tho:

1. When I talk about a general multivector V, I mean a linear combination of the form a + bv + cB + dI, where a,b,c,d are real scalars, v is a vector in R\^3 , B is a bivector made out of wedge products of vectors in R\^3 , and I is the one trivector. I know it sounds like I'm being obnoxious, but I rather define what I'm talking about beforehand, so we can all understand each other.
2. For a multivector V, define an operation \~V, which all it does is it flips the sign of the grade-0 component of V. I define it like that because I truly don't know if this is a thing with a standard name or not
3. For a multivector V, define an operation V\^\* as its reversion. (Not sure what the standard notation is, so I wrote this down for clarity).

And the solution goes like this:

For a 3D multivector V, you can find its inverse V\^-1 = V\^\* \~(VV\^\* ) / \[VV\^\* \~(VV\^\*)\]

I discovered through playing with my code that the bottom seems to always be a scalar, so when the entire thing is multiplied on the left by V, it's pretty clear that the result is 1. Does anybody know a better way to compute the inverse? Did anyone see this result anywhere, or can anyone point me to some place which talks about a multivector inverse?",math

So the probability of winning when you imply that the player always switches is 2/3 which i totally get. But what if the Player works like a Coinflip and decides randomly what to do after picking one of the three doors? 

I calculated a probability tree with the first event being the choice of one of the three doors and the second event being choosing to stay or to switch (Both with a probability of 1/2). All the winning paths summed up equals 1/2 for me. Condition is that Monty Hall obviously opens another door with a goat behind every time.

So is it dependend on how the Player is behaving so that you can see different probabilities (conditional probabilities)?

55.0,55.0,Review: Book of Proof by Richard Hammock,animegirlsruinedmen,1627166055,"Hello,

I have just finished Book of Proof by Richard Hammock and this post is a review on my experiences working through this book. I'm 30 years old entering my 5th year of university studying Math/CS. I took an extra year because I have really struggled with my Math courses and I decided to take this time to essentially relearn my Math degree. I started with this book and will now share my thoughts.

This is a VERY good book for someone who has already been exposed to university level math. I can easily see this as a 3rd year course titled ""Revisiting Math fundamentals for floundering students who barely get passing grades."" Every chapter is full of moments where you'll be like ""oh that's how that works"" and ""this isn't as complicated as it seemed"". The exercises are also very reasonable and doable without being mind-numbingly tedious. I've done about 90% of the exercises. I will say, however, that this is not the best for someone who has no previous exposure to university math. There's a lot of references you wont understand and the author writes as if you've seen what he's talking about before. You might want to look elsewhere if you fit in this category.

If you are like me and have shaky fundamentals, cant come up or write proofs, struggle in higher level classes and want to improve, this book will help you. It will demystify the logic and proof strategies for you, leaving you only to understand the mathematical objects themselves and how they interact given their definitions and previous theorems. No more will your brain pull the emergency break whenever it sees some symbol you should definitely know but never bothered to look deeply into.

This book took me roughly a month to complete. As I said, I've done 90% of the exercises and really took my time. The only thing is that I rushed the last two chapters on Calculus proofs and Set cardinality. I did this because I got the general gist of how those proofs worked, but I didn't want to dig deep into those topics within this book. I would rather work through a dedicated book that covers those topics. I did get a good high-level grasp of them, though. 

All in all, highly recommended for someone with previous university math exposure and not-so-much otherwise.",math

61.0,61.0,Petrie projections of some n-d cubes obtained through distribution of eigenvalues of random matrices,Trotztd,1627152843,"Disclaimer: I am a first year student and I do not have complete knowledge of the subject with which I play. Probably I could not see something very simple and obvious. Also english is not my native language.

I recently dived a bit into visualizing the eigenvalues ​​of random matrices and found something interesting. The distribution of eigenvalues ​​of random circulant matrices n \* n looks exactly like projections of the n-d cube! 

I have found three types of circulants that produce some projections of hypercubes. 

1. Just ordinary circulants n\*n which entries are independently sampled from 2\*X - 1 where X \~ Beta(0.01, 0.01). They create projections of n-d cube only for odd n. Probably. Projections that are too high dimensions are too messy to compare with wikipedia. I checked up to 11 and it seems that this pattern persists
2. Circulants n\*n which entries are independently sampled from (2\*X - 1) + (2\*Y - 1)\*1i  where X \~ Beta(0.01, 0.01) and Y \~ Beta(0.01, 0.01) . They make pictures look like projections of cubes in 6, 14, (18 probably but i'm not sure)  dimensions, for 3, 7, 9 values of n. ""Artifacts"" also appear, they can be removed if you change formula to (2\*X - 1) + (2\*Y - 1)\*1i + 4 + 4i or something like this.
3. Block 2\*2 matrices with two independentky created n\*n  circulants from 1.  as a  blocks.  With this structure M = \[\[A, B\], \[-B , A\]\] .  [https://imgur.com/a/6keWJT6](https://imgur.com/a/6keWJT6)  \- examples. Looks like it's working only for n = 2, 6, 10, ..., with n-d cube projections.

Pictures are histograms of superimposed complex eigenvalues of 500k matrices. Brighter color - more eigenvalues gor into this pixel.

1. As you can see on the aforementioned website, Spivak hasn't updated the errata since Feb. 14 2018. But [errors keep getting detected like on Stack Exchange](https://math.stackexchange.com/search?tab=newest&amp;q=spivak%20is%3aquestion). Undoubtedly, an up to date errata will assist readers. 

2. Adding at least one more color to the book will assist. Many  reputable undergraduate math textbooks use at least one color (on top of monochrome). I know that some textbooks use multiple colors, cf. Gilbert Strang's, James Stewart's *Calculus*, *Thomas' Calculus*.",math

I know that they were used in Reshtekhin-Turaev's construction of Witten's TQFT. Also quantum groups were apparently defined, by Drinfeld, long before Witten's TQFT. 

These relations seem to be deformations of ordinary Serre relations.

For example how do we know that 
sqrt(i) or
sqrt(x + iy) 
where x, y are real numbers are complex numbers? Everywhere on the Internet people simply assume they're complex number and not some other kind of number and get the answer. 
Someone please explain? Are we sure all mathematical operations are closed under complex numbers? Who found it out and is there a proof of it or something?
Sorry for bad English, I'm from India and not English speaker and still in high school, I need an explanation that I can comprehend

II) What's the conjugates of the complex number

1) sqrt(x+iy) 
Where x and y are reals.

2)sqrt((a+ib)/(c+id))
Where a, b, c, d are reals?

What's their conjugates and how do I find them?

122.0,22.0,Feynman Kac theorems for ODE - a connection between stochastic analysis and partial differential equations,PaboBormot,1627101164,"The purpose of this post is to share an interesting paper I came across recently, and hopefully to generate interest (especially among analysts) in stochastic calculus.

**Introduction:**
The [Feynmann Kac connection](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feynman–Kac_formula) is a celebrated family of theorems in analysis that relates partial differential equations and stochastic analysis.

Namely, they show that you can write the solution to a wide class of second order partial differential equations by running a Ito diffusion (that is, the solution to a linear SDE) for some time and taking an expected value. 

The most classical and well known case is that of the heat equation - you can write the solution u(x, t) to the heat equation with initial distribution f by running a Brownian motion X starting at x up to time t and taking the expected value of f(X_t), weighted by an exponential decay factor. More precisely, we have

u(x, t) = E[e^-t f(X_t)| X_0 = x].

**The paper:**

Recently I encountered a cool paper that does something similar but for second order ODE’s instead. Like the classical Feynman Kac theorems, it expresses the solution to an wide class of second order ODE in terms of a diffusion. 

What is most striking about the paper however is that instead of linking the ODE to the expected values of the diffusion, what is used instead is a different measure of “centrality” - the so called *mode* of the diffusion.

Informally, the mode of a diffusion is the “most likely path” the diffusion will take, similar to how the mode of a discrete random variable is the most likely value. Formally, it is defined as the solution to a certain minimisation problem involving the [Onsanger Machlup function](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onsager–Machlup_function), which describes the infinitesimal time evolution of the probability density function of a diffusion. It is the stochastic analog of the Lagrangian in classical mechanics, in a way that is made precise in the paper.

The connection is in fact established for arbitrarily large systems of ODE, which has large implications for numerical computation. Namely, the classical deterministic algorithms for solving ODE (eg Runge-Kutta) scale very badly for large systems of equations. On the other hand, though the dimension of the space  in which the diffusion lives does increase with the number of equations, the computations still work out to be much more efficient using the diffusion formula.

The authors state that the case for nonlinear ODEs - that is whether or not a connection to Ito diffusion can be made - is wide open. So if you liked the paper and happen to be qualified enough, you could potentially do some really good research. I’m not knowledgable enough in this particular field to say, but it seems like it would have some big consequences if a connection was found in the nonlinear case.

That’s about all I have to say, hope you enjoyed the write up! If this has inspired you to learn more...

**Further reading:**

If you want to learn more about the classical Feynmann Kac connection, I recommend Bass’ book *Diffusions and Elliptic Operators*. While if you want to learn more about the concepts in the paper, the references there in are a great place to start. 

For a general introduction to stochastic calculus, check out Baldi’s *Stochastic Calculus*, which covers the core theory really well and has hundreds of fully solved (!) exercises.",math

However, when I look at the math/physics people on Reddit, I saw a lot of them talk about how hard it is to stay in academia or get enough grants, and how they are forced to teach to make a living. Is the difference between what I've seen due to my location (since a lot of people on Reddit are from 'Murica) or is it due to differences in engineering vs math/physics academia?

Basically, my will for mathematics is going away.

I was really excited for the next semester due to a DG course until 3 months ago, when i started to really study hard for my tests. But when i did that, i realized i no longer was enjoying nothing at all. As a result (or not, idk) i got a reprobation in ODE, which was a subject i hated so much that even before becoming down with math i already thought in quitting.

Another thing that bothers me since my first semester is the fact that i never achieved really good grades. I wasnt bad, but my grades were always about 7/10, no matter how much or hard i studied. In a world like the academic, grades are really important and mines were never that good.

Now i am completely ashamed of myself and literally hating math. I was almost in panic with thinking in taking more math courses next semester so i changed to physics, but my real intention is to move for some IT course when possible.  I believe i will back to math some day, but for now i really want to stay far from this. 

The ""change"" was so big that i no longer want an academic/scientific career, a thing that i want as long as i can remember wanting something as a job.

I tried to think of a question I haven't seen discussed in a whole lot of detail and it has now lead me down a massive rabbit hole and at this point, I'd really just like to figure it out. The question I came up with was ""when a real-valued quadratic has complex roots, does that tell us anything geometrically?"" So my idea to figure this out was to take a quadratic function with complex roots and turn it into a function from R2 to R1; so f(x)=x^(2)\+4x+5 would become f(x,y)=(x,y)^(2)\+4(x,y)+5. Given the operations we have over the complex numbers, this becomes x^(2)\+2xy-y^(2)\+4x+4y=-5. I straight up just replaced (yi)^(2) with -y^(2) and took out all the other i coefficients. My thinking was if I treat y as the imaginary axis, that shouldn't make a huge difference but that's probably mainly where I messed up. Anyway, this gives us a hyperbola. So we've taken a parabola, projected it into 3 dimensions with the inputs slightly tweaked (I think) and found the intersection between that projection and the (x, y)-plane. What I can't figure out is the connection between the original complex roots (-2-i, -2+i) and this hyperbola. I've checked all the intersections and everything like that, but I'm wondering if someone here might be able to help because I'm one of very few math enthusiasts that I know personally. Thanks!!

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I just realized the two complex roots give the numbers to plug into x and y to make the hyperbola equation true...but what exactly does that mean in terms of the geometry of the hyperbola? I haven't worked with conic sections in an analytical way just a whole lot",math

212.0,12.0,"TIL That I Was Never Bad At Math, I Just Learned The Foundations Through Abuse.",Alsentar,1626990648,"Hey! I just found this about myself and I thought this would be a good place to share it. Maybe it can help someone, or maybe I'll find some people like me. 

Ever since I was little, I always labeled myself as ""bad at math"". I was afraid of homeworks and test, afraid of math teachers and textbooks. It wasn't something completely irrational, after all I had and still have a severe case of math anxiety, which was always ""proven"" by the fact that I can't do basic things as easely as most people can. I still have to use my fingers to add and subtract things like 5 + 7, I have to use a calculator to divide stuff because I forgot how to do it by hand, I don't know how to factorize at all and I don't remember the rules of basic operations with fractions. Now, I hear you saying ""Well, that IS being bad at math"" and I would normally agree with you and hate myself for it. But after taking a long look at myself, I discovered that it may not be my fault.

Enter my dad. My dad is a very good dad. He always makes his best effort to give our family a life of relative luxury, something that an engineer with masters like him can do. Something that he isn't good at however, is being a teacher. When he switches to his teacher persona it's like he stops being my dad and turns into a horrible college professor.  He is impatient, cruel,  verbally and sometimes physically violent, and a tad abusive. He snapped at the slightest mistake and slapped me in the back of the head with each error. He was talking on the phone the other day and I noticed how I felt tense and on edge when he spoke, and I remembered that the tone of voice he was using was the same severe tone he used when doing homework with me, it's like he conditioned me to be on my guard with just his voice, it's incredible. I remember the time I had to learn the multiplication tables, he sat with me every night for that week with a belt in his hand to ""learn"" the multiplication tables. Apparently this experience is somewhat common between people my age, so I disregarded it without considering how it affected me.

I never considered that the reason I'm slow at math is because I never truly learned the most basic concepts, I just memorized them to get out *that* situation, but I never truly learned them. I learned to say how much is 3 x 9, but I learned to avoid the belt. That wasn't learning, that was a survival tactic, and that's messed up. Over time, I got used to memorizing instead of learning. At some point in Highschool I started cheating and I started to avoid dad helping me because ""I was doing fine"". That was all that mattered to me, avoiding him. Because I would rather cheat that learn his way. It was at college that I realized how grave my mistake was and how behind I was compared to the rest. 

Enter coding. During my last year of highschool I decided that I wanted to study Software Engineering, since everyone talked about how coding is a well payed job and no one told poor young Alsentar how much math skills that would require. I started to learn coding by myself, taking small youtube courses of the basics. Through flow diagrams on programs like Pseint and Raptor I learned basic concepts like variables, use PEMDAS in code, conditions, loops, etc. After that I started learning Java, going as far as learning bidimensional arrays and basic interface design with buttons that could do basic functions. I made a program that could display the interface of a calculator that could do PEMDAS, with buttons and stuff, and I regarded that calculator as my magnum opus. I was happy back then, because from my perspective, coding wasn't math, coding was a set of tools in which you used math. This was the main reason I chose software engineering, because I thought I could be an engineer saying ""I'm a professional programmer, but math isn't my forte. No one is perfect"". 

Today I'm on my second year at college, still at software engineering. I'm one of the best programmers in my class and I get asked for help a lot. I'm having lots of trouble learning my calculus, but I manage thanks to an amazing teacher I got this semester. She's kind and patient, and she doesn't mind repeating herself if someone gets lost. Whenever I realize I understand how to do the exercise I feel so happy, and those dopamine hits I get when I finish an example and I get it right? Nothing beats that, I feel so proud of myself. I see good I am with my coding, I see how everyone says that math and coding are intertwined with logic and how I react when I understand math, and I wonder, am I really bad at math? or do I just have very poor foundations? and after reflecting for a while, here I am.",math

I heard this on the radio that there was this math problem where we don't know fully if it always resolve:  

1) Pick any whole number  
2) If Even divide by 2  
3) If Odd multiply by 3, then add 1  

If you do this continuously, so far, all numbers that have been tried resolve to 1 (eventually).  

e.g.  pick 6  

So:  
6 / 2 = 3  
3 x 3 + 1 = 10  
10 / 2 = 5  
5 x 3 + 1 = 16  
16/2 = 8  
8/2 = 4  
4/2 = 1  

But the thing that has me posting here, is that he said two things:  

1) All numbers that have been tried so far, all of them have resolved to 1  
2) We don't know for certain if this is true for all numbers (i.e. is there some weird number that doesn't do this)   

But that basically the math community hasn't really resolved this.   But it got me confused. Since all even numbers should eventually reduce. And the only odd numbers are the prime numbers.  

But this got me thinking ... and I realized the only real numbers to worry about is the prime numbers no?  

Don't all prime numbers + 1 = an even number?  

Doesn't this mean all number would eventually get resolved to 1?

Abel-Ruffini Theorem just sounds very fascinating to me, I don't know how one could prove such abstract thing about polynomials, so I decided to try to understand it, but I've got no idea on how should I proceed.

Afaik, it's about Galois theory, and for that I should probably have some idea of group, ring &amp; field theory, but I probably can't understand the whole of those theories. Currently I only know kinda the definitions of groups, rings &amp; fields so you can just say that I know almost nothing about abstract algebra.

So, do you have any suggestions on how should I proceed? Any specific terms, definitions I should be aware of; or the extent to which I should learn those theories to understand Abel-Ruffini? Or any pathways you could suggest, etc... Also I've got no knowledge in linear algebra too, so if it's also required I could use some suggestions

Also I know that I should not learn math theorem by theorem, I should probably learn those subjects on their own etc.. but I'll learn them on uni anyways. I currently want sth to spend time with. Thanks in advance",math

288.0,88.0,"On the dreaded frog riddle once again, please here me out if you will...",No-Let-9538,1626895901,"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpwSGsb-rTs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpwSGsb-rTs)

I'm sorry to bring this up again but it's driving me nuts. This riddle has been discussed multiple times in this sub, but there seems to be no real consensus on it. I've read a lot of the posts and I'm still convinced that the outcome of the riddle as presented in the video is incorrect. I don't think the chances of getting one female frog when taking the two frogs is 2/3, I think it's 1/2.

The video presents it as a matrix with four possibilities with equal probability, with M being male, F being female:

* M F
* F M
* M M
* F F

Of which the FF one is impossible, which leaves:

* M F
* F M
* M M

Based on this the video concludes that there is a 2/3 chance of there being a female. The video itself doesn't do a good job of explaining why these three scenarios hold equal probability.

To me there's an error in the logic used there, that can most easily be shown by including not two but three possibilities, I would say M is a non croaking male, F is a non croaking female, and C is the croaking frog, following four scenario's are possible:

* C M
* C F
* M C
* F C

These all have a 1/4 probability. Based on what we know about croaking behaviour we can deduse the four following scenario's with regards to gender:

* M M
* M F
* M M
* F M

Here we see a 1/2 chance of getting at least one female frog.

In other threads people talk about it being a paradox, which I don't see. And even people saying they programmed simulations that prove there is a 2/3 chance by running this experiment a large number of times. Can anybody tell me where my logic may go wrong here?",math

I'm often lost at that point. When I don't understand its motivation, reading through subsequent steps feels like I'm just merely verifying it without understanding the general idea, like a computer verifying a proof. Sadly this happens too often.

I can spend the next several hours asking for help on the internet to really understand the proof but I wonder is it worth it. I suppose I could just take the proof of a theorem on faith and do the exercises. In a few months it doesn't matter because I will forget the proof anyway, what matters is I remember the important theorems and how to apply them.

Is it a good strategy?

If you could put in a quantum state value in might have many values for one variable and I could see that you could might have a problem doing a truth table when one variable is multiple values at the same time.

&amp;#x200B;

It dawned on me that I remember the process of encapsulation when doing programming.  Lets say all the quantum state are known and are finite.  Could you theoretically map out all the quantum states in one truth table.  The encapsulate that truth table and declare all the multiple outcomes as a one variable inside another truth table using encapsulation to do it?  In the other truth table it would only be one variable, but when you go inside that variable it is truth table itself with multiple fixed values representing all the know fixed quantum states.

&amp;#x200B;

Would it work?  and if it did would it help with quatum states when doing truth tables?  Even though at the top level it is one fix viable, that one fixed viable is actually many fixed outcomes in anther truth table that is encapsulated.

From a theory perspective of my work (optimal estimation, mapping, multi target tracking, etc.) There is a lot of math left to learn that id still like to be formally taught.... and I've also found there's lots of math id like to learn purely out of self interest, but is totally unrelated to my work.

Unfortunately, I'm not smart enough to teach myself these concepts.  For math courses in particular, I've always found it basically a requirement for me to attend lectures and have some form of office hours to attend (my university actually has a ""math help center"" that's staffed full-time by the math PhD students, so I spend a lot of time there!)  

Currently, as a student, there's really no problem taking courses, or even just reaching out to professors or something with questions because I am also a student at the university....

&gt; I of course have since forgotten elementary calculus. I'm not sure if doing all the exercises made it last longer or if I forget it as quickly as I usually do.

For example, if you take a random sample and construct a 95% confidence interval for the mean, say (1,3), then either the mean is in that interval or it's not. So it's not correct to say the probability of the mean being in (1,3) is 95%. It's either 0 or 1. While I appreciate that, I feel like it's kind of pedantic, and shouldn't be heavily emphasized.  


Hear me out. By that same logic, when you flip a coin and don't look at the result, it's not correct to say the probability of heads is .5 because it is either heads or tails, we just don't know which.

424.0,24.0,"Existing work for binding error term difference between Legendre's Expanded Inclusion Exclusion form and Euler's ""Unexpanded"" Product Form?",godelbrot,1626726276,"[Legendre's Formula](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/LegendresFormula.html) returns the number of integers &gt;= x that are coprime to a set of integers. It sort of is like a generalized Euler Totient function in that it doesn't require the set of integers you are testing coprimeness against do not have to be the prime factors of x, rather they are the first n Primes. 

The problem with the Legendre Formula though is that it is extremely inefficient to calculate, as it essentially is just expanding  out a full Inclusion-Exclusion sum. For example, if we want to count the number of integers less than or equal to 19 that are coprime to the first 3 primes (2,3,5), then our Formula could look something like: Φ(19, 2,3,5) = 19 - ⌊19/2⌋ - ⌊19/3⌋ - ⌊19/5⌋ + ⌊19/6⌋ + ⌊19/10⌋ + ⌊19/15⌋ = 6. Compare this to the Euler Totient Product form that could return the same type of result with the condition that x have the first n primes as factors: φ(30, 2,3,5) = 30(1/2)(2/3)(4/5) = 8. It would be great if we could just use this radically more manageable formula for ANY values of x, using the previous example where x is 19, it would be ideal if we could just do Φ(19, 2,3,5) = ⌊19(1/2)(2/3)(4/5)⌋ **(this returns 5 when the actual value is 6, the range to which this error term can be off seems to grow with the number of primes you use)**, the reason this doesn't work is because that simplified formula does not take into effect the fractional values that we ""floor out"" in the Expanded Inclusion-Exclusion form. In fact it easy to show that the explicit difference between this simplified Euler Product form and the Expanded Inclusion-Exclusion form is the exact same Expanded sum only applied to just the fractional terms that you ""floored out"" and with the operations inverted. 

What I am trying to figure out is if there are any known ways of binding what this difference is, so that I can get the simplicity of the Euler Product form but having provable bounds on what the error term for it is.

I get 90%+ in all my maths exams at school, am top of the class, and participate in a range of maths related things. I want to study Computer Science at a top UK university (my dream is Imperial College London), and then become a software engineer at a big company like FAANG or MBB or a Bank. I have just finished my GCSEs (secondary/high school final exams from those who are not familiar) and have the summer to myself. I have been spending my time on some extra reading into my A levels (pre University level studies) as I am taking maths and further maths. However, I mainly have been practicing past papers and questions from the Senior Mathematical Challenge (SMC), an exam in the UK used to determine the very best young mathematicians, eventually cancelling out to 6 students who represent the UK in the International Mathematical Olympiad. Whilst I am good at maths, I know I am not IMO let alone BMO standard, which is fine as you must be top in the country, I am just happy to get a Gold in the SMC next year. Anyways, my point is I am good at maths and enjoy it.

However, I am not aiming to pursue a degree let alone a career as a mathematician. But I still love maths, and after focussing my time on my education, will still like to do maths on the side as a hobby when I grow up. Is this possible? Is this common? Is there anyone right now doing this? Does a ""amateur mathematician"" exist? I'd like to think so. But do I have to be super smart at maths, what if I am not that good, do I need to be Olympiad standard? Please comment or message me, I'd appreciate advice. Thanks.",math

Then, recently, I joined a learning group where each of us has to pick a topic to talk about. I accidentally choose a topic that doesn't have any standard reference, i.e. most of the exposition of the topic is lying somewhere in some paper.

But I've committed to the topic so I couldn't quit now, I decided to just spend as much time as I needed to look for papers that are relevant and try to understand them. It wasn't exactly a nice experience. As an undergraduate who doesn't have that strong background, there were a lot of unfamiliar terms and calculations going on. I must have spent three full days on this, but I ended up understanding more than I imagined.

In the end, I seem to give a satisfactory talk, but I think the more rewarding part is that I'm not afraid of reading math papers anymore. Even if the terms and calculations are unfamiliar(for some cases, I even need to just take something as true for granted without fully understanding it), I think one can at least understand the author's purpose by doing some extensive googling, keep it in the back of your head, and maybe after a couple of years of study when you look back at the paper, you would just understand everything easily.

451.0,51.0,Closed moment evolution equation for continuous state Komolgorov equation,underquailified,1626702340,"Recently I've been working with population balance equations that describe fragmentation processes, where large particles break up into smaller particles.  For example, a particle of size x breaks apart with rate x\^m and the product particles have size x\*L\*dL with probability P(L)\*dL.  I believe that the governing PBE equations are basically a 1D continuous state Komolgorov equation.

The governing population balance equations are easy to write out, but they're often a pain to solve (especially if coupled to a fluid mechanics problem).  However, if one is just interested in solving for a few moments of the distribution then a popular strategy is to simplify by applying a Mellin transform and a closure approximation - but there's at least two problems with that:  (1) sometimes using standard moment closure approximations will converge to the wrong answer, and (2) even when that's not the case you still have to solve for a large collection of moments even though you might only use one or two.

After some manipulation, I found that it's possible to pick the moment you're interested in and solve for it directly.  I think that this result is pretty neat looking, and it uses some new-to-me tricks in its derivation.  This result doesn't appear to be known to the literature on population balance equations, so I wanted to query the mathematical community to learn if there is a broader context for this kind of result - especially if it is already known to another field.

I've posted a two paragraph summary of the equations below, and I can produce my notes on its derivation as well if there is interest \[it involves setting up an infinite sum for the Laplace transform of the moment, manipulating that sum to produce a recursion relation in Laplace space, and the applying the inverse Laplace transform to the recursion relation\].

I've been doing well in the graduate courses so far. 

However the issue is that I have no written proof of my understanding of ""the basics"". Essentially there is little mention of real analysis, point-set topology, etc on my transcript.

That is, outside of a certain delta x, the function behaves similarly to a cryptographic hash function. This would likely be a smooth transition.

All examples of chaos I have read investigate how small changes in initial conditions amplify over many timesteps. After a sufficiently small number of timesteps, two sufficiently similar initial states S and S' can be related by some transformation. As additional timesteps occur, the transformation loses accuracy until it is no better than a guess. I suspect that a similar phenomenon exists for deviations in input to a function, but I have no idea what the functional form would be.

To avoid being too cryptic: I have extremely rich multimodal synesthesia, and I am looking for some sort of mathematical description of it. If I was listening to a song, and I increased the bass, for example, I could imagine how that would change the shapes/colors/textures that I perceive. The song would get a lot wider and most of the non-base components would shrink and push towards the center of my vision. Now, as more attributes of the song change, I quickly lose the ability to predict what the song will look like afterwards. With sufficiently many changes, I have no predictive ability; I must just listen to the music. And the features that I assign to songs have no long range meaning. For example, if I recall listening to a song that has glittering white rectangles spinning and falling down in the center, I can't reason anything about the actual music. I can't guess the genre, the gender of the singer, what musical instrument is making those shapes, etc.

Write 29 as (2/9)^2

ie fragment it into 2 parts. Let 2 = a and 9 = b

Now, we know that: (a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab +b^2
So EVEN though, a and b aka 2 and 9 when added together DON'T make 29, we shall use the identity for these two numbers

So we get:

a^2 = 4

2ab = 36

b^2 = 81

Now here's the trick, write them in the following format:

a^2 / 2ab / b^2

We get:

4/36/81

Now what you gotta do is take the number at the ones place aside and carry over the numbers at tens, thousands, etc to the next compartment starting from right aka

We take 1 from 81 and carry over 8 to 36

Now 8+36= 44

Now similarly take 4 from 44 aside and transfer the 4 at tens place to next compartment


We get 4+4 in last compartment aka the a^2 one, keep this as it is.

clubbing in the format of the computed/kept aside numbers in the a^2 2ab and b^2 we get

841.

Similarly for a 3 digit number like 384

Write them in the format (39/4). Remember the slash should always come before the ones place and then use the method I taught. Very good party trick and fairly easier than multiplying. I apologise if it's already been known here on this subreddit.",math

545.0,45.0,Improving on the Babylonians,rickpolak1,1626560811,"Here's a famous method for computing the square root of a positive rational number d: define a sequence as x\_0=d, x\_(n+1)=1/2(x\_n+d/x\_n). Then lim x\_n = **√**d. This is usually attributed to the Babylonians.

Heuristically, this works because you're averaging your current candidate x\_n and d over its reciprocal,   so if x\_n is too large, d/x\_n will be too small, and you keep averaging until you get \~**√**d. More rigorously, the function f(x)=1/2(x+d/x) is a contraction on  \[**√**d, +∞), with fixed point **√**d.

I started looking for functions in the same spirit, but which gave faster convergence methods. A key property of f is that it doesn't involve irrational numbers, which would of course defeat the purpose. With this in mind, the contraction property, and a little bit of calculus, I think the 'fastest' Laurent polynomial with terms of orders -3,...,3 is g(x)=1/8(3x+6d/x-d\^2/x\^3), which I would say turns out pretty neat. Here's a [desmos plot](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/dxudwvvwkx) for comparison with the first method.

The [rate of convergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rate_of_convergence) for the Babylonian method is quadratic, whereas the one using g is cubic, which I'm pretty happy about. Obviously using something as elementary as Taylor series gives an arbitrarily large rate of convergence, and there's [many other ways to go about this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methods_of_computing_square_roots). Rather, I was wondering if someone knows anything about such polynomials: any suggestions for higher order ones? Say there's a best one per order, what rates of convergence are achieved? Is there research into these kinds of things?

&amp;#x200B;

Disclaimers: 

1. I'm an algebraist so I don't know much about numerical approximation.

2. I believe g is the best among the Laurent polynomials of orders -3,...,3 using rational numbers, but I may be wrong, I would love to see a better one! I also believe if you allow terms -2,...,2, the best one is still f.

3. Computing the rate of convergence for the method using g analytically would be a lot of work (at least for me), so I just wrote some code to use [this formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rate_of_convergence#Order_estimation), giving \[2.4538342185, 2.9343800162, 2.9997468597, 2.9999999999, 3.0000000000, 3.0000000000\].",math

Q(x) = 1 / (2 ln x)

For open ended, the easiest example is prove or disprove type problems but also includes stuff like ""object X is defined by Y, what can you say about it?"" Of course, problems like this require some flexibility on the instructor's part as well as the students' part.

Any researcher will tell you that knowing whether something is true makes a big difference.

In my courses, I found that I was often able to solve problems just by looking at the assumptions I was given and what the problem asked me to prove and just looking for theorems relevant to either of those and just mashing things together until I solved the problem. This approach builds mechanics, but doesn't really lead to any deeper understanding imo.

Is it impossible to keep up, or even come close towards, your IMO medalist/genius peers?

As a high school kid, I was always in awe of genius mathematicians, perhaps similar as how regular kids look up to Messi or Ohtani now. I'm sure that many of r/math can relate

I always thought that I was pretty smart as well. I did better than most of my peers in olympiads, some of whom had some ridiculously expensive tutoring (my own family isn't that well off).

As an incoming freshman intending to major in math at a top school, I decided to take an upperdiv 'intro analysis' class this summer. Feeling super proud for doing decently well. 

But just yesterday, I found out that there was a middle schooler that got an A+ in the same class, 2 years ago, who is currently taking several graduate classes... as a junior in high school. He seems beyond reach to me.. but what's more amazing, is that this guy isn't even an IMO qualifier. 

I knew that regular people couldn't become Messi or Ohtani, especially without an elite pathway starting very young. But I do think that I love math for what it is as well.  

&amp;#x200B;

Should I keep studying math? Am I too late to reach glory? 

If I decide to keep studying math, and don't end up as a genius, what will my career be like?

602.0,2.0,Mystery Sign - a multiplayer web math puzzle game,tanboonhing,1626502641,"Hi everyone! I made a web multiplayer math puzzle game inspired by a math game in the grand final episode of the South Korean reality game show ""The Genius"" and I hope that I could get more people to play it and get some feedback as well. The game can be found at [here](https://mysterysign.com). 

You can play with your friends or play it alone on mobile/desktop.

In each round of the game there are hints and a problem to solve. 

 For example, the problem is **5?10= \_\_** and the hidden rule is the **sum of the squares of the two numbers**.  
If the hinters give the numbers **3** and **2**, the hidden rule will be applied and the hint given will be **3?2=13** as **3****^(2)** **+ 2****^(2)** **= 13**. After seeing the hint, you must find the hidden rule based on the hint and solve **5****^(2)** **+ 10****^(2)** to get the answer **125**. 

The more detailed explanation on how to play can be found at the website.

To show how the game fundamentally works, here are 3 example problems with hints to solve, I gave the first answer away in the spoiler tag.

I haven't found it anywhere on Google and nothing on [Inverse Symbolic Calculator](http://wayback.cecm.sfu.ca/cgi-bin/isc/lookup?number=0.42829243506424686&amp;lookup_type=simple) looks conclusive given only the digits I've accurately calculated it to (roughly 5). 

The process for generating this number goes like this:

Place a circle with a circumference of one along the number line with a tick mark facing downwards and have it roll forwards. For each time the tick mark completes a rotation and touches the ground (in other words for every number), if there is not another circle opposite of it with a matching tick mark, then create one with a circumference equal to the number of rotations of the original (non intersecting). [Visual representation.](https://imgur.com/a/xKa4Vnl) 

This is the same as the [Sieve of Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes) which finds every prime, but it's cool that you can recreate it with a construction like this. So what properties can be extracted from this structure? To start, every number can now be represented not only as its prime factorization, but to relative to every prime that preceeds it, with its prime factors being circles whose tick marks align with the base circle. Next, for any number you can add up the total fractional rotation of each of its prime wheels (Sum primes p &lt;= n of n mod p / p). This series for total rotation is divergent, so we can constrain it by dividing by the total number of circles (primes), turning it into a series for average rotation (1 / pi(n))(Sum primes p &lt;= n of n mod p / p).

From what I can tell this converges, but since I have little experience with proofs, the best I can do to back that up is look at the size of the variations between each value of n. In the program I wrote to calculate this series each value initially (&lt; 100K) varies from the last by 1E-4, but by around a million it mostly varies by 1E-6 with a few 5s mixed in. After a million it gets really slow even reading from pre-calcuated primes so I haven't gone much past that.  The value I have at a million is **0.42829243506424686**


I'm interested to see what you guys think of this number. Seen it before? Can it be proven to converge?

But what if we could distinguish ""good proofs"" from ""bad proofs""?

As a ridiculous example consider ZFC+⊥. (Assuming ZFC is consistent.)

Here we could have ""good proofs"" that don't use ⊥, and that wouldn't make the theory useless. In fact if we restrict ourselves to not using ⊥, we just have ZFC.

Ok, but what's the difference between this and ZFC?

Well, this was a stupid example, but my idea is that it's not the same to restrict your axioms, which may change the strength of your theory dramatically, than rather work in the proof space directly, again by distinguishing ""bad"" from ""good"" proofs, in some way to be well defined.

Another two good historical examples were naive set theory and mltt71. Both inconsistent, but that didn't make the proofs done in these systems useless. In fact many were ""translatable"" to their corresponding (presumably) consistent descendants.

I know almost nothing about HoTT, I'm starting a mini-course in about 2 weeks. But just intuitively it seems like it's a notion that could help us define this distinction between ""good"" and ""bad"" proofs.

Maybe we could start by extending the theory with ⊥ and then it is sufficient to ask for proofs non-homotopic to proofs that use ⊥. I have no idea to be honest, just a first idea.",math

If you look at the 2nd digit of a prime number, and take the gap to the proceeding prime, the number is barely above 3 (30). It reaches 30 and sometimes 40 the closer you get to 10k. I believe the first time it even increases above 32 (2 to the 5th power) is around 9600.

[http://www2.cs.arizona.edu/icon/oddsends/primes.htm](http://www2.cs.arizona.edu/icon/oddsends/primes.htm)

If you go even deeper to 106033, the gap is 54 to the next prime 106087. There might also be a gap threshold for numbers of 2 to the 6th power.

These are numbers that only come out the deeper you go.

**Formal problem (Graph theoretic version):**

For n &gt; 2, let G be the empty graph on n vertices. Let k &gt; 1 be a given fixed integer. We are allowed to select subsets A_1, …, A_k of the vertex set of G of cardinality m each, where km &gt; n. 

 For each subset A_i, we connect all vertices in A_i to each other. To be more precise, we form the graph G’ with vertex set that of G, and edge set E(G’) = {(a, a’)| a, a’ ∈ A_i for some i}.

Question: How can we maximise |E(G’)|? And what is the maximum?

There is also a continuum/continuous version of the problem, which may be easier to deal with since it avoids problems with discreteness of individual people.

I've been working with a Physicist professor from undergrad on a paper for a bit. While working on that paper, I stumbled on something relevant but also outside the scope - a problem in geometry and optimization only recently (10 years ago) solved in low dimensions then claimed to be analytically unsolvable for higher dimensions (and has been accepted as that for about 5-7 years). Over the last 8 months I would work on this problem on my own time every now and then but go nowhere. Finally, I was able to construct an analytic solution and I generalized it it for n-dimensions - also proved it is indeed a solution satisfying all conditions.

To me it is a bigger feat than the paper I'm working on with the prof. The issue is, I told him about it and he thinks I could just add it as an appendix to this current paper. I don't think that's good, and I'm certain it is worthy of publishing on its own and in fact it is a more important result than what I've been doing.

For those with experience in linear algebra: is it possible to compute the transformations of standard basis vectors retroactively?

If not, what addition info would be needed assuming T : R2 -&gt; R2.

721.0,21.0,Looking for an article about the social nature of mathematical proof,TwoFiveOnes,1626368629,"There was a great article I read once, that ponders what it means to prove something mathematically, and argues that in large part it is a network of social agreements of a sort. Basically they argue that very few people are capable of understanding any given proof, and most of the times most details of a proof are not fully described, therefore for most people it comes down more to network of credibility than any ""all the way down"" logical procedure. And I think it also discusses that many times it doesn't even matter, since working mathematicians are moreso interested in whatever new intuitions or ways of approaching *their problems* may arise from the conclusions or even the procedures of a proof, with details being sorted out by the course of history e.g. the early calculus of the 18th century later formalized by Cauchy, Weierstrass, etc.

It was a long time ago so take my description with a grain of salt! I may be mixing in my own interpretations and thoughts that I had reading the article.

**On understanding.**

&gt;He always says, when studying and learning, one has to understand thoroughly, especially for mathematics. Remembering logical process without understanding is useless. He took rank in linear algebra as an example. Why row rank is equal to column rank? Every second year student who has finished linear algebra can prove it. But what does it essentially mean geometrically? Physically? Seeing this question from different aspects, you will receive surprising results.

**On himself being a PhD supervisor (and he loved big Rudin).**

&gt;... On one hand, he thinks extremely highly of hard works on pure mathematics and establish a solid ground on theoretical analysis. On the first day I arrived at MSU, I heard my fellow Chinese classmates said, **to be a PhD student of Professor Li, a necessary (not sufficient) condition was having passed** ***Real and Complex Analysis*** **by W. Rudin**. On the other hand, he emphasises that student should have a good habit of computing with computer, and he is strongly against “paper warfare"" style of studying computational mathematics.

**More details on his teaching**

&gt;... He thinks most of abstract mathematics start from a mathematical module for concrete problems, then mathematicians abstract and generalise the method to solve more problems of the same kind. When studying 'higher level mathematics', one has to start from 'lower level mathematics', having a good knowledge of its development history. If not one will get lost and don't know what to do, or has to remember logic, theorems, proofs, to pass the exam.  
&gt;  
&gt;... Every student attended his seminar will never forget his requirement: not only talk about ""epsilon-delta argument"", which is merely logic, but also the philosophy, ""basic idea"". Also in seminar, he asked his students to start from concrete and fundamental examples to general theorems, never play hide-and-seek in abstract concepts. Most of his students had a hard time with it, but most of them also became professors mastering teaching.  
&gt;  
&gt;He believes, if one really understands some subject, even high school students can understand what he or she is talking about. And he demonstrate this philosophy by himself. On every talk he gave, he started with elementary concepts, guiding the audience with obvious observations, which fascinates the audience greatly of course. In 1986 when I was in his office and ready to do a report on a paper by a well-known professor, he told me ""Treat me like a fool. I know nothing"". I was quite confused: another well-known professor that I pursued a chance to study from, ""knew nothing"". But it was because of facing a ""knowing-nothing"" professor, that his protégé learned what was research in mathematics and teaching in mathematics.",math

I struggled a little when multiplication was introduced, but my mother helped me understand it by telling me to picture a certain amount of baskets with a certain amount of kittens in it. For example, 3 x 4 would be three baskets with 4 kittens in each of them. This worked well for me and I actually enjoyed doing it.

Then, it all went downhill quickly. My teacher started doing 'drills' in class. She would start with, let's say, 7 x 2 and then go down the line (7 x 3, 7 x 4, 7 x 5, etc.) and pick random students for each. We would have to answer right away or else she'd make a buzz sound and pick another student. I'd get horrible anxiety and wouldn't be able to answer even the simplest multiplications. I started to hate math. Whenever I failed to understand a concept later on, I'd just abandon it out of fear. This led to me getting lost early on in the school year and just never catching up. In 8th grade, a teacher commented on my report card that I ""lacked basic math skills"". After that, I just gave up. I failed and had to retake algebra I. 

The only person who could get me to enjoy a math class and actually learn was a professor I had my first year of undergraduate studies. I went up to him after the first day of class and told him that I would likely fail the course, that I wasn't smart enough to learn even basic math, and asked if there was a way to just bypass the math requirement. He told me to stick with it and he'd help. He had such a chill and low-pressure way of teaching math. I looked forward to his classes. He was entertaining, approachable, friendly, and willing to help. He also concentrated more on understanding than memorization. Unfortunately, as I studied literature for my BA, MA, and PhD, I never bothered to take another math class, and now I can't remember most of it. 

I'm 31 now and a tenured professor. I still wonder whether I  just have math anxiety or if I'm lacking some sort of cognitive function necessary to understand mathematics. 

The brain is basically fully developed at 31, right? I want to learn and I'm interested, but I assume it's too late if I struggle with basic things like long division and the multiplication of large numbers (I can't do them in my head at all and it takes me some time to work them out on paper).

824.0,24.0,PhD in Math without majors in Math,coronil_cures_corona,1626238762,"I graduated from a premier institute in India with mechanical engineering as my majors. I always wanted to do a majors in math but due to personal reasons and the culture here I chose engineering over pure sciences. Now I am a working professional who wants to pursue PhD in mathematics, the only thing I have with me is my determination and the courses that I have self-studied. I have self-studied Real Analysis, Algebra (both linear and abstract), etc. I know what proof based math is and I am very much interested in it, so much that I really want to make a career out of it. 

&amp;#x200B;

So for this when I started to search for good graduate programs outside India all these programs had a strict requirement of completing some basic bachelors level math courses and obtaining a certain grade in them. In my bachelors in mechanical engineering I had no such courses which can even get me through the minimum eligibility of programs outside India. And even I believe that without formal education, surviving in a PhD just by self-studying would be very difficult. Since I have little to no experience with pure math research, I am not sure how to proceed even on applying to any graduate program. It is like being stuck and there is no way I can get out of it. I tried to cold mail professors to take me as a research intern so that I can gain some experience by working on a research project and have something to back up my grad school application. But as expected I got no replies and negatives as answer (which is understandable I guess). 

&amp;#x200B;

So I want to ask this community, that how shall I go on with this? What can I do now? Can I take online courses from MOOCs and show them as subjects taken? Is there a way that I can convince professors to take me as a research intern just by showing  them my self-study thing?

826.0,26.0,Coming up with a general formula for compound interest when there is a fee at the time of accrual,monkfacedmonkey,1626238088,"I recently decided to try and find the formula for a problem where there is a standard compound interest rate and a fee that is subtracted from your accrual when you decide to accrue your interest. So, for example, suppose you have an interest rate of r% annually and you can choose to compound as frequently as you like. However, every time you compound there is a fee F withdrawn for the action. Because of this fee, it would not make sense to initiate a compounding until you have accrued enough interest to at least offset the fee. If you compound continuously, you will lose all your money to fees, but if you don't compound at all, there is money left on the table. Ultimately the question becomes, ""What is the ideal interval at which to compound your account interest with an annual interest rate of r%, an accrual fee of F, and a principal balance of P?""  


To make things simpler I also would like to assume that the fee does not change with the amount of interest accrued or principal in the account.  Just intuitively, we know that the ideal rate of compounding should increase as the principal increases under these assumptions since the amount of time it takes to offset the fee by accruing interest will become smaller and smaller. 

I thought something for this must already exist, but I haven't found it and am having trouble coming up with a general formula on my own. By going about this the usual way of deriving the compound interest formula for n compoundings, I found that the normal P(1-r/n)\^nt formula nicely factors out to the front, but the we are left with a subtracted fee term that doesn't seem to play as nicely.   
So for the one compounding a year we get an accrual (A) of:  
A = P(1+r/1) - F  


Then for two compoundings a year we end up with:  
A' = P(1+r/2)\^2 - F(1+r/2)  


So here it may seem like the fee term is just going to be raised to n-1 instead of n and we can look for our ideal interval to compound, but going further, we see this is not the case  
A'' = P(1+r/3)\^3 -F((1+r/3)\^2+1)

A''' = P(1+r/4)\^4 -F(((1+r/4)\^2+1)(1+r/4)+1)  


And I can see a sort of expected pattern emerging where we just have the previous fee term multiplied by (1+r/n) and then + 1 but I'm not sure how to write this for a general number n of compoundings per year. Something like   


An = P(1+r/n)\^n -F(...)  


If anyone knows an answer or has an idea for finding the ideal number of compounds, give it a shot.

Suppose you have the following data:

     a1 = rnorm(1000,100,10) 
    b1 = rnorm(1000,100,10) 
    c1 = rnorm(1000,5,1) 
    train_data = data.frame(a1,b1,c1) 
    
    #view data          
    a1        b1       c1
     1 94.39524 90.04201 4.488396 
    2 97.69823 89.60045 5.236938

     4 100.70508 98.67825 6.219228 
    5 101.29288 74.50657 5.174136
     6 117.15065 110.40573 4.384732 

We can visualize the data as follows:

    #visualize data par(mfrow=c(2,2))  plot(train_data$a1, train_data$b1, col = train_data$c1, main = ""plot of a1 vs b1, points colored by c1"") 
    hist(train_data$a1) 
    hist(train_data$b1)
     hist(train_data$c1) 

[https://i.stack.imgur.com/t641h.png](https://i.stack.imgur.com/t641h.png)

Here is the **Problem** :

1. From the data, only take variables ""a1"" and ""b1"" : using **only 2 ""logical conditions""**, split this data into **3 regions** (e.g. Region 1 WHERE 20 &gt; a1 &gt;0 AND 0&lt; b1 &lt; 25)
2. In each region, you want the ""average value of c1"" within that region to be as small as possible - but each region must have at least some minimum number of data points, e.g. 100 data points (to prevent trivial solutions)
3. **Goal** : Is it possible to determine the ""boundaries"" of these 3 regions that minimizes :

* the mean value of ""c1"" for region 1
* the mean value of ""c1"" for region 2
* the mean value of ""c1"" for region 3
* the average ""mean value of c1 for all 3 regions"" (i.e. c\_avg = (region1\_c1\_avg + region2\_c1\_avg + region3\_c1\_avg) / 3  
)

In the end, for a given combination, you would find the following, e.g. (made up numbers):

* Region 1 : WHERE 20&gt; a1 &gt;0 AND 0 &lt; b1 &lt; 25 ; region1\_c1\_avg = 4
* Region 2 : WHERE 50&gt; a1 &gt;20 AND 25 &lt; b1 &lt; 60 ; region2\_c1\_avg = 2.9
* Region 3 : WHERE a1&gt;50 AND b1 &gt; 60 ; region3\_c1\_avg = 1.9
* c\_avg = (4 + 2.9 + 1.9) / 3 = 2.93

And hope that (region1\_c1\_avg, region2\_c1\_avg, region3\_c1\_avg and c\_avg  
) are minimized

**My Question**:

**Does this kind of problem have an ""exact solution""?** The only thing I can think of is performing a ""random search"" that considers many different definitions of (Region 1, Region 2 and Region 3  
) and compares the corresponding values of (region1\_c1\_avg, region2\_c1\_avg, region3\_c1\_avg and c\_avg  
), until a minimum value is found. Is this an application of linear programming or multi-objective optimization (e.g. genetic algorithm)? Has anyone worked on something like this before?

I have done a lot of research and haven't found a similar problem like this. I decided to formulate this problem as a ""multi-objective constrained optimization problem"", and figured out how to implement algorithms like ""random search"" and ""genetic algorithm"". **Can someone please tell me if this general approach makes sense?**

Thanks

**Note 1:** In the context of multi-objective optimization, for a given set of definitions of (Region1, Region2 and Region3  
): to collectively compare whether a set of values for (region1\_c1\_avg, region2\_c1\_avg, region3\_c1\_avg and c\_avg  
) are satisfactory, the concept of ""Pareto Optimality"" ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-objective\_optimization#Visualization\_of\_the\_Pareto\_front](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-objective_optimization#Visualization_of_the_Pareto_front)) is often used to make comparisons between different sets of {(Region1, Region2 and Region3  
) and (region1\_c1\_avg, region2\_c1\_avg, region3\_c1\_avg and c\_avg  
)}

**Note 2** : Ultimately, these 3 Regions can defined by any set of 4 numbers. If each of these 4 numbers can be between ""0 and 100"", and through 0.1 increments (e.g. 12, 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, etc) : this means that there exists 1000 \^ 4 = 1 e\^12 possible solutions (roughly 1 trillion) to compare. There are simply far too many solutions to individually verify and compare.

839.0,39.0,[D] Convincing mathematicians that good programming practices are important,foxfyre2,1626229355,"TL;DR How do I get my traditional math-oriented coworkers to give a hoot about good programming habits?

I recently graduated with my MS of Statistics, but of lot of my program involved programming and writing a few packages for my advisor. Along the way I read a good amount about program design and good coding practices, especially in the way of version control and keeping code modular.

Recently I started a job on a team of mathematicians. A big part of what we do is writing simulations using a shared C# library. Both the library and the simulation code are all in the same project, and every person is working on the same SVN branch, putting their sim code in code regions and only uncommenting the simulation that they plan to run. A few of my new team members will also only commit once a month.

This has resulting in me pulling changes from time to time and having a failed compile because someone forgot to commit a file or class or whatever it may be. Or an intern will try to push his changes and then there are merge conflicts.

I suggested that we separate the shared library into its own project, and then to separate future simulations into their own projects as well, and to simply reference the library and projects in a single solution. I was met with general indifference and a comment about how one likes that committing can cause a build error because then someone else can catch their mistake if they forget to commit a file.

While the current system of writing and managing simulation code works, it feels fragile and there are definitely better practices that can be put into place. Putting everything into one folder and working off of it simultaneously is no better than working off of a shared drive or using Google Drive to do version control (worse since some only commit once a month).

What can I do to demonstrate good coding and project organization practices and get others on my team to care about them as well? Alternatively, has anyone else been in a similar situation and how did it go?",math

850.0,50.0,Question for those of you who use intuition more than rigor in problem solving,FLSeph28,1626216405,"So I know the above might be vague or loaded terms. Basically I am aware that there are people who when presented with a math problem have a predisposition to solve it using less structured rigorous processes but still arrive at the right answer and gain some sort of knowledge through the process. Then there is the more systematic way most of us are taught to solve problems.

The intuitive way could mean lots of things happening behind the curtain. Relating the structure of a problem to things you know in real life, patterns you've seen before, simulating quantitative ideas somehow. Often this type of problem solver will appear to have flashes of insight and not be sure how they arrived at their correct conclusions.

So if any of you have this or have had this early on in learning math I have a few questions.. but to ask, ""how do you approach a problem"" might be silly if for you it's spontaneous, so I'm just going for behaviours.

Do you gain insight after a period of frustration? Or In a calm state? Or a state of play?

Do you draw pictures, visualize talk out loud, or is it all happening in your head.

Do you attempt to solve problems before being taught the nessesary techniques, just how every you can? Do you regularily take on problems that require you to stretch your thinking beyond any techniques you've been formally taught(even just challenging puzzles).

Are you confident that you can ""figure it out"" whatever it may be?",math

En un día nublado, un maleante tiene un rehén atado a una silla a 1 metro de él, mientras amenaza a la policía que si se acercan, matará a la víctima con el arma que tiene en mano; la policía solicita un francotirador para deshabilitar al criminal, el cual se posiciona en un edificio sabiendo la direccion que tiene que apuntar, pero no ve nada por la neblina, así que pide datos a la policía, y le dicen: La altura del edificio en que él esta es de 20 metros, y que la distancia del edificio hasta el maleante es de 15 metros.

Personally, I'm a computer science person with an interest in math, but I'm curious how many people here are the opposite, with a mathematics background but an interest in computer science.

This came to mind today since I'm dealing with, er, more concrete math than a lot of people here like to. That is, it isn't good enough for me to say ""well, I can write down the integral the describes this number perfectly"", I have to figure out how I could *efficiently* represent that as iterative steps that progressively converge on an exact answer.

In doing so I have had to read several math/computer science papers that have been published over the last 50 years. For instance, I am attempting to improve the performance of my program's Bernoulli Number generator, and came across this paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1108.0286.pdf

But it's just... there's too much notation and reference to other papers that I don't understand. I'll figure it out, it'll just take me 100-200 hours of research.

But it occurred to me that there might be people on the other side of that: completely able to grok papers like the one above, but bottle-necked by the notation and syntax of programming despite having an interest.

862.0,62.0,Is my answer correct?,thenewkid505,1626201086,"So I came across the following question:

"" ***You are writing down all the positive integers in increasing order, starting from 1, until you have written 1000 digits, at which point you stop (even possibly in the middle of a number). How many times have you used the digit 7? Explain your reasoning briefly but clearly ""***

So I have the following answer:  
""***First we identify how many numbers are being counted to:***

***1-9 = 9 digits***

***10-99 = 90 numbers which are two digits = 90\*2 = 180 digits***

***this leaves 1000-180-9= 811 digits left***

***This means the 811 remaining digits belong to the 3 digit numbers, so this leaves 811/3 = 270 numbers remainder 1 digit***

***Because this is from 100 forward, this means the 1000 digits belong to 1 to 9+90+270 r 1 = 369 remainder the first digit of the next number = first digit of 370 = 3 which is not equal to 7 so can be ignored in this case***

***The next aim is to find the number of 7 digits from 1 to 369***

***I begin by finding the 7s from 1 to 100 = 07,17,27,37,47,57,67,77,87,97 which if you count leaves 11 7's in every 100. Therefore from 1 to 300 there are 11\*3 = 33 7s. Now we need to find the number of 7s from 300 to 369 = 307,317,327,337,347,357,367 = seven 7s and therefore the total number of 7s in the first 1000 digits is the total number of 7s from 1 to 369 which is equal to 33+7 = 40 7s.""***

I would think my answer is right, however when asking another subreddit on university (this question is from a university entrance exam) a student replied that I was incorrect and explained his answer as the following:  
""***First, when do we get 1000 digits? Let's use the one-digit and two digit options - that's 9 + 2 \* 90 = 189. So, we have 811 digits to go. If*** ***x*** ***is the number of 3 digit numbers, we get 3x = 811 -&gt; x = 811/3 = 270 1/3. So, We go up to 369 as a result, and then the 3 in 370.***

***Now, how many of them are 7s? We have 10 \* 2 = 20 up to 100 (7 and the two-digit numbers that have 7). Now to find the number of 0s up to 369 inclusively, we need to find the 3 digit numbers that contain 7, in the same way. Repeating this for the 100 - 200 combinations, we again get 20. Same for the 200 - 299 (no extra calculation is needed because the first digit is not a 7). Then, for 300 - 369, it's {307, 317, 327, 337, 347, 357, 367}, which is 7 more. Hence the final answer is actually 60 + 7 = 67, not 40.***

900.0,0.0,An alternative perspective on the St. Petersburg Paradox,fungtimes,1626152104,"The [St. Petersburg Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Petersburg_paradox#The_St._Petersburg_game) is about a game of chance that goes like this:

The game starts with $2 (or some other amount of money) in the pot. The host flips a coin. If it's tails, the player gets all the money in the pot, and the game is over. If it's heads, the pot doubles, and the coin is flipped again, until the coin comes up tails, in which case the player gets all the money in the pot, and the game is over.

The paradox is that the expected payout of this game is infinite, even though most payouts will be small, and the actual chance of receiving an infinite payout from one game is literally next to zero.

There seem to be a number of ""[solutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Petersburg_paradox#Solutions)"" to this paradox that have been proposed over the 300+ years since the paradox was discovered. But all of them seem like cheating to me: discounting the value of money as one makes more, discounting unlikely events, limiting the amount of money the host has, rejecting the expected value as meaningful, calculating the expected value from a finite sample, arguing that no rational person would play this game. 

This is shocking to me; it's as if no one wants to face up to reality! Some of these proposals were put forth by practical-minded economists, but the oldest solutions were proposed by mathematicians, who I would have thought would know better.

The paradox arises because the more times this game is played, the higher the mean payout gets. It goes up very slowly (typically by log2(number of games)), but like the log function, it will tend toward infinity. In other words, even though this game can in most circumstances be played for a long time, it is inherently unsustainable, and will eventually bankrupt any host with finite resources. Yet all the proposed solutions seem to try to get away from this fact, just because the chances of a bankrupting payout are very slim. 

To me, the lesson of this paradox is that, for the host, this game carries huge [tail risks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taleb_distribution), which Nassim Nicholas Taleb has long talked about: very low probability events that nevertheless bring very large losses. These catastrophic events happen rarely, but after enough trials, they eventually will happen.

The St. Petersburg Paradox seems to require not a solution, but merely acceptance. Infinities are generally hard to accept because they are practically impossible to observe. Nevertheless, the math tells us that the game in the paradox is unsustainable in the long term, and no amount of theoretically-wrangling can get away from that fact.

Each tennis game is essentially play to 4 points, win by two, and sets  are play to 6, win by two (if there is no tiebreaker). This led me to look at the probability of winning a general game where you play to X and must win by two. Abstracting from the fact that players have different probabilities of winning whether they're serving or not, assume each point is i.i.d. Bernoulli with probability of player 1 winning of p. I created some simple code in Matlab that uses dynamic programming to find the probability of winning the game at the start.

    function P_win = prob_win(p,p1_score,p2_score,min_score)
       
        if max(p1_score,p2_score) &gt;= min_score
            if p1_score == p2_score
                P_win = p^2/((1-p)^2+p^2);
            elseif p1_score == (p2_score+1)
                P_win = p + (1-p)*p^2/((1-p)^2+p^2);
            elseif p2_score == (p1_score+1)
                P_win = p^3/((1-p)^2+p^2);
            else P_win = p1_score &gt; p2_score;
            end
        else P_win = p*prob_win(p,p1_score+1,p2_score,min_score) + (1-p)*prob_win(p,p1_score,p2_score+1,min_score);
        
    end

The closed form values I plugged in there if the score is at least the minimum score is easy enough to calculate using value functions. Passing through different values for min_score through, we get an interesting pattern for the probabilities.

Can someone please give me source or a general guide about which normalization method to use according to the feature matrix at hand ? 

I have read in some sources that if the feature matrix (rows: samples; columns: variables) has the same scale and the same unit then normalizing is not necessary, but centering is. In others, they did not discuss centering but rather they applied a column wise log-transform on the whole frequency matrix to make the variables more comparable. 

The problem that I have is that my feature matrix is the same scale and the same unit, the variance of the variables decreases naturally with the column number (the columns at the beginning of the matrix varry a lot but the columns at the end not that much, I should point out that all the variables are acquired in one point in time and space from the same sensor)

I am mainly interested in the columns at the end, where I can see for sure that there is information, which is why my goal is to compare the loadings and not the scores, because I am not interested in classification, I am just interested in locating the mix of information.

I have tried all the mentioned approaches, what I did notice is that with centering my variance explained for the first pc goes down from 80% (with log-transform) to 11% (with centering), the loadings remain the same. Centering and normalizing brings it down to 10%, the loadings still look the same. Would it be better to use the 80% scenario with calculating the intercept?

953.0,53.0,A question on Ramsey numbers,PenguinVillageSun,1626055414,"Hi everyone,

I'm extremely naive when it comes to graph theory, so I apologize in advance if any of this is entirely too basic/trivial/boring/etc. I recently discovered the math manga ""Mathematics Golden,"" which I absolutely had to start reading, and in the first chapter, we come across the following problem:

&amp;#x200B;

[Not a very likable main character so far...](https://preview.redd.it/q8ap1v8wooa71.png?width=935&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=42bf3fce6886b13b0311e6c204b892d836c87221)

Anyway, as soon as I saw the problem, I had to solve it since it looked fun. As stated by the main character, the problem involves (easy) Ramsey numbers since we are looking for a monochromatic triangle in K\_17 ([Wikipedia - Ramsey's Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramsey%27s_theorem#A_multicolour_example:_R(3,_3,_3)_=_17)). While the linked Wikipedia article defines Ramsey numbers in more generality, I'm just going to be focusing on monochromatic *triangles* (so my cliques are just on three vertices). Thus, let T\_n = R(3, . . . , 3), where the number of listed 3s is n. That is, we're looking for monochromatic triangles on complete graphs with n colors. Notes T\_1=R(3)=3 (easy), T\_2=R(3,3)=6, (see below), and T\_3=R(3,3,3)=17 (see below, which is the solution to our manga problem). Let's sketch the proof of T\_2&lt;=6 (because it's fun!):

&gt;Consider a vertex v of K\_6, colored by red and blue. By the pigeonhole principle, at least three of the edges incident to v are of the same color. WLOG, suppose they are all red, and call the other vertices x\_1, x\_2, and x\_3. Now, if any of the edges between the x\_i are red, we are done. If not, then all three edges between the x\_i must be blue, and we have a blue monochromatic triangle.

While this gives an upper bound, it remains to show there exists a two-coloring of K\_5 without monochromatic triangles. Then we get T\_2=6. (I'm very sorry if my weird notation is making the graph theorists cringe!)

The proof of T\_3&lt;=17 is also fun:

&gt;Consider a vertex v of K\_17, colored by red, blue, and green. By the pigeonhole principle, at least six of the edges incident to v (call the other vertices x\_i as above) must be of the same color--WLOG, say red. If any of the edges between the x\_i are red, we're done. Otherwise, all edges between the x\_i are blue and green. Consider the K\_6 subgraph formed by such vertices x\_i and the edges between them. By the T\_2 argument above, this subgraph contains a monochromatic triangle, so K\_17 does as well.

Now, my naive question is as follows: can we just repeat this process for T\_n to get easy upper bounds? Is there a slicker way to prove things like T\_2&gt;5 and T\_3&gt;16 than actually constructing colorings on the complete graphs? The only thing we use is the pigeonhole principle, and by repeating the above steps, the process gives T\_4=R(3,3,3,3)&lt;=66 and T\_5&lt;=332. It doesn't take too much effort to find the recurrence relation

and solving the recurrence shows

which is a fun little inequality to have after playing around with this.

If you'll pardon another naive question, is the above inequality actually an equality? It'd be fun if that was the case!

Anyway, if any graph theorists decide to read this and want to correct me on anything I've said above, I implore you to do so! (That, and if you can avoid getting too frustrated with my made-up notation and--what I'm sure are--many incorrectly worded concepts.)",math

963.0,63.0,I don’t know what I don’t know.,Drippie1010,1626043687,"Hey guys. I’ve searched for hours before coming here. I’m making an equation for my own personal calculator.

H&gt;=G+((G/A)-1)0.125
H= the width of my starting piece of wood
G= the width of the finished product
A= thickness of starting piece of wood
Constant 0.125 is how many inches the sawblade will take off each time I cut.

How do I represent in my equation that whatever (G/A) equals, I want it to completely disregard all digits to the right of the decimal place? I want it to calculate the value, then round down to a whole number before it gets multiplied by 0.125

The situation is, I need to take a board and cut it longways into long pieces. The width of the pieces I cut will be equal to the thickness of the wood. This will create rectangular prisms. Let’s say my board is 12.5” wide, and 2.25” thick. I will cut it in 2.25” strips. This will create 5.5 strips of wood. The 5 whole strips will be useable, but the waste material will not be. 
If I am able to get 5 strips from the board, I will have to cut 4 times. Every time I make a cut, the saw blade takes 0.125” of material. Even though 5.5 translates into 6 pieces of wood, I do not care about the 0.125” taken from the sixth piece that is waste.
The point of this equation is to be able to plug in the width and thickness of my projects final dimensions, as well as the dimensions of a piece of wood to see if my chosen lumber can satisfy my equation, thus being wide enough.

I want my equation to take (G/A) and turn it into a whole number. In the case of G=12.5, A=2.25, I would like it to use 5 instead of 5.5

I’m sorry if I’m super confusing. Any help is appreciated!
I’m going through such lengths, because I’m a woodworker looking to create a product that is exactly 19x12x2 every time, and must be able to see if the board I have chosen can fulfill those dimensions.",math

Now I'm almost 100% there's a theorem about this, that says basically exactly what I said, something along the lines of:

I'm currently going through a udacity course and we're covering Kalman filters.  They've handed us the formulas which are easy to code, and a conceptual idea of what they're doing, but I'd like to know more, namely why the formulas work the way they work.

Concretely, ;-)  We have the following equations.
A formula for gaussians. 

[;p(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}e\^-\frac{(x-\mu)\^2}{2\sigma\^2};]

[;\sigma\^2;] = variance (why squared?)

[;\mu;] = mean

1. The lesson says ""Note the term before the exponential serves as a dampening factor"" does that mean that the height of the gaussian diminishes as [;\sigma;] grows?

2. How does the power term affect the output of the function?  Why is it negative? Now that I'm reading this a little more closely it's starting to make a little sense.  

3. Why is the power term negative? [;(x-\mu)\^2;]  is the absolute value (squared) of the distance of x from the mean, ah divided by the total distance of the variance?  why squared and why multiplied by 2?


Next question, to calculate the new mean,

[;\mu\^\prime =  \frac{r\^2\mu + \sigma\^2v}{r\^2+\sigma\^2};]
where

[;\mu\^\prime;] = resulting new mean

[;\mu;] = mean of the prior gaussian

[;\sigma\^2;] variance of the prior gaussian

[;r\^2;] = new measurement variance (again why squared)

[;v;] = new measurement mean

The explanation is 

""The answer is - the uncertainty of the prior is multiplied by the mean of the measurement, to give it more weight, and similarly the uncertainty of the measurement is multiplied with the mean of the prior. ""

My questions are

1. Are the terms all added because basically the result is the average of all of the ... weighted means over the total variance?

2. if a new measurement is more accurate (reduced variance) wouldn't that result in a smaller value, and the old mean with the new variance would be biased less than the new mean with the old variance?  If the new variance is better (smaller value), shouldn't it pull the old mean more towards the resulting mean?

lastly, to calculate the new variance 

[;\sigma\^{2\^\prime} =  \frac{1}{\frac{1}{r\^2} + \frac{1}{\sigma\^2}};]

As the variances get larger, the old probability distributions are added together?  that makes sense mentally, but in actuality as the variances grow larger, oh.... the resulting variance also grows....  right?  Its basically the average of the, what exactly, probability distributions?

To each irrational number *x*, there is some value M(x) called its [approximation (or Markov) constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_constant) in the interval [√5, ∞] that helps quantify *x*'s irrationality.

There is also an equivalence relation on the real numbers by which we say that *x* ~ *y* if and only if their simple continued fractions (SCFs) ""have the same tail""; i.e., if we can make their SCFs identical by deleting some possibly-different finite numbers of terms from the front of their SCFs.

**Questions**

1. If *x* ~ *y*, then *M*(*x*) = *M*(*y*).  Under what circumstances does *M*(*x*) = *M*(*y*) imply that *x* ~ *y*?
2. For each *z* ≤ 3, the above-linked article provides constructions for numbers *x* with *M*(*x*) = *z*.  What other ways are known to generate *x* with prescribed *M*(*x*)?
3. Which numbers between 3 and Freiman's constant are part of the Lagrange spectrum?

**What I know/suspect so far**

1. If I am reading the above-linked article correctly, then *M*(*x*) = *M*(*y*) &lt; 3 implies that *x* ~ *y*.
2. The implication fails for *M*(*x*) = *M*(*y*) = 3 as a corollary of a result in that article.
3. I suspect that for each *M*(*x*) = *M*(*y*) = *z* &gt; 3, there are also uncountably many *x* with *M*(*x*) = *z*, and consequently the implication would fail in such cases as well.

However people also think of complex numbers and quaternions as ""numbers"" or for example infinte ordinals. People also think of the familiar integers as ""numbers"" even when situated in very different contexts, like ""5"" is still a ""number"" even as a p-adic number or as a member of a cyclic group. On the other hand, I think people would find it very strange if you referred to a matrix as a number, even though it is similar to many of the objects mentioned so far. There are also more exotic objects that also attempt to measure quantities in more abstract setting using various algebraic objects that noone considers numbers either.

Most popular games allow you to customize your sensitivity for each available zoom level in the settings which I do. In order to keep my aim consistent between different games I use the same aspect ratio and FOV as well as using this formula to set my sensitivity for different scopes: 


y=410*(0.85^x )+10


x= scope zoom level
y= degrees per 44cm (my mouse pad)


This has worked well so far with the games I play, however, I recently downloaded Overwatch, which has scopes and allows you to customize your sensitivity with each, but does not tell you their magnification. 


I looked it up and most people guess or estimate, which would be fine but out of curiosity I wanted to see if I could determine the zoom level by comparing it to another game. 


I chose Apex legends and overlaid screenshots of each scope level available and took measurements of the area and distance from the screens center for each zoom level in the hopes of using these data points to create a graph which could predict a scopes zoom from an overlaid screenshot.


I assumed the relationship would be some kind of exponential regression, I used a ""line of best fit"" calculator online to give me possible relationships for each of the 4 different measurements I took (area, vertical distance to center, horizontal distance to center, diagonal distance to center), but all 4 appear to be incorrect with similar looking residual plots:

1044.0,44.0,Serge Lang explained his philosophy of writing books... Let's call him Chad Lang.,Desvl,1625917214,"If you don't know who Serge Lang is, let me describe it... He put the Riemann Hypothesis (one of the most important hypothesis in mathematics which has troubled mathematicians for centuries) as an exercise in his Complex Analysis book, and told the reader if he or she could not solve it, ask their professor. In general he was a well-known mathematician especially known for his textbook-writing. But most of his books will bring you purest pain if you don't meet his expectation.

In his 1983 book [Fundamentals of Diophantine Geometry](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780387908373), he included [L. J. Mordell's review](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/bulletin-of-the-american-mathematical-society-new-series/volume-70/issue-4/Review-Serge-Lang-Diophantine-geometry/bams/1183526083.full) of Lang's own book [Diophantine Geometry](https://www.worldcat.org/title/diophantine-geometry/oclc/651771066) which was ended by

&gt;In conclusion, the reader will need no convincing that Lang, as has already been said, is a very learned mathematician, thoroughly familiar with every aspect of the topics he deals with, and their developments. His interesting and valuable historical notes give further evidence of this. Lang assumes that his readers are as knowledgeable as he is, and can grapple with the subject with the same ease that he does. Even if they could, Lang's style is not such as to make matters easy for them. Lang in writing is not a follower of Gauss, whose motto was ""*pauca sed matura*."" Further thought and care about his book, before publication, would have been well worth while. Those who can understand the book will be indebted to him for having brought together in one volume the important results contained in it. How much greater thanks would he have earned if the book had been written in such a way that more of it could have been more easily comprehended by a larger class of readers! It is to be hoped that so me one will undertake the task of writing such a book.

And he also included his [response](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/bulletin-of-the-american-mathematical-society-new-series/volume-76/issue-6/Review-L-J-Mordell-Mordell-Diophantine-equations/bams/1183532391.full):

&gt;All my books are meant to be understood by readers having the prerequisites for the level at which the books are written. **These prerequisites vary from book to book, depending on the subject matter, my mood, and other aesthetic feelings which I have at the moment of writing.** When I write a standard text in Algebra, I attempt something very different from writing a book which for the first time gives a systematic point of view on the relations of Diophantine equations and the advanced contexts of algebraic geometry. The purpose of the latter is to jazz things up as much as possible. The purpose of the former is to educate someone in the first steps which might eventually culminate in his knowing the jazz too, if his tastes allow him that path. And if his tastes don't, then my blessings to him also. This is known as aesthetic tolerance. But just as a composer of music (be it Bach or the Beatles), **I have to take my responsibility as to what I consider to be beautiful, and write my books accordingly, not just with the intent of pleasing one segment of the population. Let pleasure then fall where it may.** With best regards, Serge Lang.

1059.0,59.0,Is using Competition Questions to Learn Research Maths a Waste of Time?,kirbyburgers,1625890727,"Hi all, 

I'm 16, and I really enjoy mathematics. I love the beauty of it, and although I'm simply a novice, I'm passionate and spend most hours in the day learning, and doing, math. I'm far from a ""math kid"" - I disliked, and was rather bad at, math, until about a year and a half ago. I first was introduced to math in an applied sense by self-teaching machine learning, but now I think I actually find the math itself more interesting. 

I'm not a math competition kid either, but recently, I've really enjoyed doing math competition problems. Not necessarily because I want to win competitions (although I might as well enter them, now) but because they're clever and I like to think I'm getting better at ""thinking mathematically"". 

I'm looking to going into mathematics research (and am very passionate about trying to get into the space before graduating HS). For the past year-ish I've taught myself linear algebra / calculus / multivariable calculus / probability, but I felt like I wasn't ""understanding enough"" - even though I was able to do most of the problems - I think it was just my severe lack of ability in proof-making that made me self-concious.

Now I'm going back a bit - I've completedand done all the questions in ""Art of Problem Solving Vol 1."" in the last 25ish days and am planning to go onto Vol 2. tomorrow, and hopefully have that done in a similar length of time. Then, I'm planning to re-learn calculus more ""rigorously"" with Apostol, do a similar thing with linear algebra, and then statistics, and then hopefully begin more ""modern maths"". 

**my question is:** I'm using competition math to practice maths, because I feel like it'll make me understand it better. But I'm worried that I'm ""wasting my time"". I read often that being good at competition math is not directly correlated with research mathematics - so should I go back to starting where I left off with linear algebra? 

I know this is a bit of a weird question, so many apologies for that. I'm just worried that maybe I'm using up a lot of time trying to be ""more confident at maths"" by going back to more basic concepts when I instead should be going back to the slightly higher-level concepts.

My view that I *should* go back and review is reinforced by the amount of novel things I'm learning in these AOPS textbooks. Like who knew that there's *three* ways to find the area of a triangle!? And I find it all quite fun - but - my summer break is only so long, and I don't want to use up too much time reviewing concepts or learning things that might not even come in handy when doing higher level mathematics.

I'm sort of aware that this is probably narrow-minded in some dimension, but I'd be so happy to hear someone more experienced in mathematics than I offer a word.

1064.0,64.0,Proof that sqrt(2) is irrational that works for other numbers too:,niftyfingers,1625884850,"I found a different proof that sqrt(2) is irrational an it goes as follows:

Assume for contradiction that sqrt(2) = n/m where n and m are integers.

=&gt; 2m^2 = n^2 .

If two numbers are equal, they are congruent mod k for any k = 1,2,3,... . Furthermore, if m doesn't have an inverse in kZ/Z under modular multiplication, then m is divisible by k.

Consider the equation 2m^2 = n^2 mod k for a prime k. Assume m has an inverse and call it M. That means 2 = (Mn)^2 mod k. However, 2 is [not a quadratic residue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_residue) (a is a quadratic residue if a=x^2 mod k has a solution) when k = 3 + 8r for example (where r = 0,1,2,3,...). Let k be the first prime in that list. Since it is impossible for a square to equal 2 mod k, 2 = (Mn)^2 mod k is a contradiction. Therefore the inverse M does not exist, and m is divisible by this k.

Assume again that m has inverse M. Let k be the second prime in the list 3 + 8r. Again, it is impossible for any square to equal 2 mod k, so certainly (Mn)^2 does not. This means M does not exist and thus m is divisible by the second k.

Assuming m has inverse M and letting k be, in succession, each of the primes in the list 3 + 8r, shows that m is divisible by each prime in that list. That list is infinite. Therefore, m is divisible by infinitely many primes. Every integer is divisible by finitely many primes however, so m is not an integer. We said m was an integer however when we declared sqrt(2) = n/m. That is a contradiction and thus sqrt(2) is not a ratio of integers. 

QED.

____

I then got thinking about quadratic residues and the irrationality of square roots of the naturals. Clearly the same method should prove sqrt(3) is irrational. In the proof I'd end up with 3 = (Mn)^2 and 3 should be a non residue mod infinitely many primes k, and [apparently it is](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_residue#Law_of_quadratic_reciprocity). So I believe **my method would work to prove any number of the form sqrt(N) is irrational, as long as N is a nonresidue for infinitely many primes.**

If 3 was a non residue for finitely many primes then m would be divisible by finitely many primes and could clearly exist. The way it works is that when you set sqrt(N) = n/m, N being a non residue for infinitely many k means m is divisible by those infinitely many k. If N actually is a residue, then M could exist, and then you could find m and n. For example,

sqrt(9) = n/m.

let k = 2. Then 9 = (Mn)^2 mod 2 , so 1=Mn mod 2, so m=n mod 2, and by trial and error, m=1 mod 2. Then m is either 1 or 3 or 5 or 7 or so on, and the same for n. So m is 1 and n is 3.

Consider still sqrt(9) = n/m with k = 11. Then 9 = (Mn)^2 mod 11. Taking square roots, we get 3 = Mn or 8 = Mn mod 11. That gives  3m = n mod 11 or 8m = n mod 11. It's not a surprise that out of these possibilities, m=1 and n=3 again gives a solution to sqrt(9) = n/m.

All the perfect squares have finitely many primes k for which they are nonresidues mod k, if I understand correctly.",math

1085.0,85.0,Group Representation Theory over non-algebraically closed field,alfa2zulu,1625864882,"The typical setting (at least at first) in finite group representation theory is that you work over an **algebraically closed** field of characteristic not dividing the order of the group, looking at finite-dimensional representations.

I *vaguely* remember reading somewhere that ""algebraically closed"" is typically overkill - actually we just need *enough* roots in the field for things to work out - for example, to use Schur's Lemma, we want the representation of each group element to have a full set of eigenvalues. 

In general, ""how many"" roots is considered ""enough""? For example, if n = |G|, is it enough to work over the splitting field of x\^n - 1? If that's not ""enough"", what is? Again, I vaguely remember something about characters always taking algebraic integer values - is it also true that representations are always realisable over algebraic integers (or at least algebraic numbers)?

A similar question to this - some people study real representations of a group (as opposed to complex representations) - is the related topic of ""representations where we don't have enough roots"" an active area of research? Are there any relevant references for this?

I'm thinking back to my classical ""calc 2"" proofs as I sometimes do to just make sure I remember how they all go, but I found myself stuck somewhere and was hoping for guidance:

The typical ""classic"" proof that the harmonic series diverges is where you show that a finite number of terms always adds up to more than a specific number. If I recall correctly, it's usually that the first term by itself, then the following two terms, then the following 4 terms, etc. etc. adds up to at least 1/2. Thus the series can be rewritten like an infinite number of things larger than 1/2 and thus it diverges.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is why does the same argument fail for say, a different p-series? Like say p = 2. I certainly believe that those series converge by the integral test, which I can prove also, so that's not why I'm concerned. I'm just unsure what to tell a student who might be asking me about this one day.

1097.0,97.0,I wrote a program to calculate the odds of winning a fight in a card game I enjoy playing. Would love to chat about it and get feedback on it.,KillerTwinkie7,1625850167,"Hey all,

I had posted this in r/boardgames, but didn't get super positive reception. Figured I'd share what I did here, as you all might enjoy it a bit more.

First of all, the code can be found [here](https://github.com/KillerTwinkie7/tboi). It runs in Python, although I'm an amateur programmer at best, so there's no GUI or anything particularly jaw-dropping about the program. I've also never uploaded anything to GitHub before, so if there's any issues with it, please let me know!

Since the game (The Binding of Isaac: Four Souls) that inspired this program isn't super well-known, I'll do my best to explain the gist of it here. Essentially, your character has a certain amount of health and attack damage, and monsters have a certain amount of health and damage, but also a dice roll value (like 4+, for example). In the game, if you choose to attack a monster, either it dies, or you do. To deal damage, you must roll a dice value greater than or equal to the value printed on the card. If you roll lower than that value, you take damage equal to the amount printed on the monster card. If you roll higher, you deal damage equal to your total damage output ([here's](https://imgur.com/a/YCsN3A0) an example of a character card and a monster card with their listed values) What I wanted to figure out was: given that I know everything in play (both my character's health and damage, and the monster's health, damage, and dice roll), what are my odds of successfully beating the monster?

On top of the values listed on the cards, there are a plethora of cards that alter your health and damage, plus ones that can prevent damage. I have also taken this into account in the program, although it's implemented primitively. Basically, all this does is increase the amount of chances you have left, even though not every card can directly be interpreted as giving you another chance.

All in all, this was a fun little project that I made in some spare time, and wanted to get some feedback and constructive criticism about it. I'd also love to shed some more light on my methodology if anyone's interested. Thanks for reading!",math
1098.0,98.0,Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Coding Theory (But Were Afraid to Ask),Mustersenf,1625849382,"Since we had a very interesting question on dense sphere packings, space communication and error-correcting codes yesterday, I thought it would be a good idea to add some literature on the topic.

To keep it short and simple:

""Fundamentals of Error-Correcting Codes"" by Huffman and Pless from 2003 is a good starter if you want to get into the topic of ECC. The only downside is that in the last 18 years, there has been a lot going on (especially in deep space communication) so you will miss out on some of the cool stuff. But it is a really great book to get into the topic.

And if you really have time on your hands and want to get to know a really interesting field, you can take a look in the ""Concise Encyclopedia of Coding Theory"" by Huffman, Kim and Solé from 2021. It is ""fresh from the printing press"" so to say. And it goes really in depth, so it will take longer to read and work through it.

If you are lucky, maybe you can get the books from a mathematical department's library. But the newer one will probably take some time until it gets stocked. But if you know a university with a coding theory department, maybe you could convince them to buy it.

1099.0,99.0,"""Learning styles"" and math education",FinitelyGenerated,1625848844,"I was watching Veritasium's latest video [*The Biggest Myth In Education*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhgwIhB58PA) (great watch) and it got me thinking about the role of hands-on work, diagrams, etc. in mathematics education.

A summary of the video: in education there is the VARK theory (Visual, Auditory, Reading/Writing, and Kinesthetic) which says that individuals have different modes of learning and that they learn best when the instruction matches their preferred mode. The video explains that there is, in fact, no data to back up that theory and gives some different theories of why people say they learn better visually. Basically if you already believe yourself to be a visual learner and you see a helpful diagram, you will see this as evidence of your visual learning preference even if that diagram would be helpful to anybody. Then, if you hear a great explanation of something or carry out an insightful experiment, you will think of that explanation or that experiment being great by itself and not see that as evidence that you are not strictly a visual learner.

How does this relate to mathematics?  Well, in other fields, it's quite clear what mode of instruction yields the most effectual examples. In music, auditory instruction is generally the best choice. In geography, visual. In natural science, hands-on experimentation. So what about in math? Well, in all education there is a concept of ""reinforcement,"" you need to see the same concept multiple times or practice with the concept a few times before it sinks in.

Let's look at some example subjects. First, linear algebra. So for many students, linear algebra is going to be the first place students encounter multidimensional pictures or objects. And so a lot of teachers will show them the concepts visually, by drawing pictures, demonstrating vectors using sticks in three dimensions, then will explain the concepts algebraically, using formulas. So even thought the concepts aren't deep (we know what a line is, what a plane is), it is the translation between the visual concepts and the algebraic concepts that presents the challenge. Students will need to practice through homework or practice problems of how to translate these concepts between the visual picture to the algebra and back (not to mention translating all the new terminology). Fortunately, we now have excellent software like Geogebra that helps make experimenting with this easier.

Next, let's look at combinatorics (because that's what I'm teaching right now). So right now I'm in the process of teaching about tree algorithms: Prüfer codes, Kruskal's and Prim's algorithms. If this were a physics class, it would be clear what to do: explain the concepts in class, and have them conduct experiments in the lab section. I don't have the luxury of a lab section so I have the practice the algorithms at home or I will sometimes pause the class to let them work out an example before going over it.

For context: my students are largely CS or engineering majors with a small number of math majors. So most (but crucially, not all) of them know programming. So to explain Kruskal's and Prim's algorithm, a lot of the discussion is on how to implement it (priority queues, heaps, how to actually detect cycles). If they were pure math majors, maybe a discussion on matroids would be more beneficial instead. On the other hand, just because you're a pure math major, does not mean you only want to see theory and little implementation details. Likewise, just because you're an engineering major, doesn't mean you don't want to see any theory.

Some discussion points:

- are there any examples, explanations, exercises, whatever, that really stand out as being exceptionally helpful to learning a concept
- what would/should be the equivalent of a physics or chemistry lab section in mathematics? Should we have programming labs? Do you think that current tutorial/recitation sections (whatever you call it where you are) should be changed at all?
- how do you feel about theory vs implementation? Do you feel like as a pure math major you would have liked to learn more about how to implement something in place of the theory? (Or vice versa if you saw more implementation.)
- how do you feel about learning the theory at home and practicing it in class vs the usual method of theory in class, practice at home?
- do you think that the VARK model (which is experimentally non-verifiable) has set back education at all?",math

*I honestly feel that I know less mathematics than I did when I got my PhD.* I remember thinking when I graduated that I was going to finally sit down with classics and learn things like Analytic Number Theory, refine my knowledge of Abstract Algebra, finally get through *Banach Algebra Techniques in Operator Theory,* but ***I didn't***. I graduated with a solid understanding of Functional Analysis and Operator Theory (perfect scores on my PhD exams in those subjects), but my Algebra was my biggest Achilles' heel. It's probably not a surprise for me to tell you that I didn't go into Operator Algebras, haha!

After graduation, *my knowledge became much more specialized*. I went further and further down the rabbit hole of Functional Analysis and Dynamical Systems. Slowly, I have forgotten most of the peripheral subjects that I studied in Graduate School, and I got better and better at using the tools I had trained on.

What I have learned from all of this is that it isn't about knowing everything about mathematics, or about knowing every aspect of Differential Geometry, nuances of Topology, or knowing how to prove Fermat's Last Theorem (understanding that one is on my bucket list). **What it takes to be a mathematician is to learn how to find problems that you can solve, and knowing when it's worth solving them.**

Sometimes, this means that my lectures were 20 minutes to 30 minutes, but moved at a very fast pace. I relied on the fact that these were all asynchronous, and that students can pause and rewatch these videos as often as they needed.

Ultimately, I got a better reception from my students when I used a shorter format, but it took a lot of time to figure out how to get it just right.

Thanks in no small part to this subreddit, have finally hit the 1000 subscriber mark. **And I assembled this video that goes over everything I've learned lecturing in this way.**

[https://youtu.be/2mHGldkkQwo](https://youtu.be/2mHGldkkQwo)

I also give a tutorial for ***Open Broadcaster Software***, which is a really nice piece of software for either streaming or recording your lectures. It lets you include all sorts of elements, such as program windows for PowerPoint, Beamer, or MATLAB, and also allows you to embed images and slideshows, which I leverage for displaying equations.

On r/matheducation one Redditor told me that they use the green screen feature together with a document camera to seamlessly bring up a written document in the middle of a slideshow, so that they can get into some details on problems.

**Have you taught in an asynchronous format during the quarantine? What have you learned from all of the different ways we've had to teach this past year and a half?**

So I have always been interested in Mathemetics in general but I got too busy to learn much of it, I am not great at it but I remember trying to solve Pell's equation for a few months. Lots of time spent but I liked it, and I figured out this formula of sorts that works for values of n one less and one more than a perfect square. 

I am pretty sure someone else has already figured it out millions of years ago and probably a simple substitution in the current formula to find Pell's equation will yield mine (I haven't even looked at the current used method to generate the Pell's solutions), but I still want to share it.

Let *a* be a perfect square, then the solutions to values of **n = a - 1** and **n = a + 1** are

x1 = 2a - 1, y = 2(a)^0.5, n1 = a - 1
x2 = 2a + 1, y = 2(a)^0.5, n2 = a + 1

So if a = 4, then
x1 = 7, y = 4, n1 = 3
x2 = 9, y = 4, n2 = 5

You can try it for whatever value of perfect square you want.

Now I know that some calcs can be done this way e.g. arithmetic mean. And many other by thinking through it and using some math magic hopefully it’s possible.
What I want to know is, is there a field of math that generalised this to prove the universe of functions that can be precisely calculated using only f(d) and the new data d2? Or is it just trial and error?

1221.0,21.0,Instancing and the Halting Problem?,KhaosComplex,1625686673,"I recently saw the Veritasium video on math being incomplete and I had a question regarding whether or not the concept of instancing could help avoid the halting problem becoming a contradiction.

To best describe what I mean by instancing, it’s best to build up the context first and then express it organically.

First, we can start off by defining a program, H, that returns whether or not a given input is true or false. An easy pseudo code way of defining this is:

program H (bool BoolParam)
    return BoolParam;

Very simple, just return the input we passed in. Now, let’s define a new program, H+ that takes in a program and returns the opposite of what it returns. 

program H+ (program ProgramParam, bool BoolParam)
    return !ProgramParam(BoolParam);

Now we have a program that essentially returns the opposite of the output produced by a different program that we pass in. 

If I am understanding it correctly, the halting problem posits that a contradiction arises if you try to execute: H+(H+, true) to define whether or not H+ itself will return true or false given the input.

Let’s break down what happens:
H -&gt; true
H+ -&gt; false
H+(H+) -&gt; true

H+ is now returning both true and false because it is a self reference. However is this not also a proof of why H+(H+) != H+? I.e. these are two separate instances of the H+ program, because they took in separate inputs. 

Where I’m trying to extend this to the halting problem is to say that if we had a program that could predict whether or not another program halted. And let’s say we then made a new program that just returned the opposite of what the first program determined. And then fed this new program into itself to determine whether or not it would always halt or not, the contradiction is avoided by the fact that the input passed down is different as it goes through each layer. These are separate instances of the same program running, but because they are separate instances, they are allowed to produce different results. I.e. instead of H+ predicting the nature of H+, it’s better to say H+ of itself, only predicts the nature of H+ of itself, not H+ itself.

I am sure this idea is flawed, or that maybe what I’m saying is true but does not help in the context of incompleteness. So I guess my broader question is to ask whether or not the idea of instancing could help when it comes to the problems of self reference? I.e. is there a place in pure math where this can in fact help? Thank you.",math

But then I had this thought: let's say my 4 chairs are in a row and I label them 1 to 4, I the mapping is simply to reverse the order of chairs. Instead of being ordered 1,2,3,4 they are now 4,3,2,1

This is a mapping but there is no unchanged point

However if I applied this transformation to a continuous set there would be no problem, the point in the middle would be unchanged

Then I kept thinking of many possible mappings of the chairs around the room that quite simply don't have that property of maps of having unchanged points, but in each case if I applied this mapping to a continuous set there would be no problem

So I wonder, does this theorem not work with discrete sets?",math

1231.0,31.0,Equal sums of n and n+k consecutive nonzero squares,BruhcamoleNibberDick,1625671056,"In [a thread](https://redd.it/o72g41) from a couple weeks ago, [a paper by Alder (1964)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00029890.1964.11992315) was linked. This paper looks at sums of n and n+k consecutive nonzero squares. That is, it looks for solutions to the equation:

x^(2) + (x+1)^(2) + ... + (x+n-2)^(2) + (x+n-1)^(2) = y^(2) + (y+1)^(2) + ... + (y+n+k-1)^(2)

with k, n, x, y in the positive integers. More specifically, it asks for which values of k there exist solutions. For example, (k,n,x,y) = (1,1,5,3) represents the pythagorean triple 5^(2) = 3^(2) + 4^(2), where k=1 signifies that there is one more term on the right-hand side.

Long story short, I found [solutions for all remaining values of k below 100](https://pastebin.com/173iE6Xa). The original paper did not find solutions for k = 30, 66, 82 and 98, so I encourage you to verify that my solutions for these are correct. As an example, the solution (k,n,x,y) = (8,11,17,7) is interpreted as follows:

17^(2) + 18^(2) + ... + 27^(2) = 7^(2) + 8^(2) + ... + 25^(2)

Indeed, both sides in the above equation result in 5434.

The missing values of k were proven by Alder to have no solutions. They fall into the following categories:

- k is congruent to 7, 11, 16 or 20, modulo 27.

- k is congruent to 3, 4 or 5, modulo 8.

- k = 2 or 14 (these were proven separately)

-

Some other things I found were that every odd value for k &lt; 1000 has a solution, as long as it is not excluded by the above conditions. Also, solutions for n=k can only exist when k is congruent to ±1, modulo 6.

Is there any interest in these results? Has this been done before, and if not, should I develop them further and/or publish them?",math

I am a university student interested in geometric analysis and several  complex variables. These subjects both require the prerequisites of a   study in differential topology and partial differential equations.

I am looking for a dedicated study partner(s) to join me in a study  through either of the two subjects (or both, if you wish). I am currently reading through the following two books:

*Introduction to Smooth Manifolds* by Jack Lee, and

*Partial Differential Equations* by Jurgen Jost.

For differential topology, I would like to read up to at least the 18th chapter on the de Rham theorem, with a treatment of the 22nd chapter on symplectic manifolds. For PDEs, I would like to read through most of the  book (\~400 pages).

&amp;#x200B;

P.S. The selection of these books are aimed to arm myself with the prerequisites required to read Lee's Riemannian Geometry text and Jost's Geometric Analysis text, as well as Helgason's text.

**Prerequisites:**

If  you would like to study with me, for differential topology it is best  that you have learned point-set topology that includes a treatment of  precompactness, paracompactness, and at least a surface-level survey of the fundamental group and covering spaces. Analysis is also   recommended.

For partial differential equations, real analysis goes without saying. A  course in  complex variables would also be helpful. There is some measure  theory in the book, but that is not until later and we can always review.

Please DM me if you are interested, and we can then speak further about how  we  will go about managing our study. Thank you for reading :)",math

In physics the work done is the integral of the force against the distance (and not the time!)
I think the analogous is true when studying too.
In particular the amount you have learned is not the integral of how hard you've tried against the time you've spent
Let me make some examples. Let's say you are working on a homework problem.
If you look up the solution straight away then your effort is basically zero, and even though you make a lot of progress in solving the problem, you barely learn anything.
If you solve many easy problems then you are indeed making a lot of progress, but since the effort is small you don't learn very much.
If you work on a very very hard problem, giving it your everything for 4 hours straight but then giving up without the complete solution, then you have only learned a small to moderate amount since none of your ideas actually quite worked out and confirmed your approaches.
Only if you put in effort and do succeed at making good progresd towards a solution do you really learn a lot.
This means that it is really worth it to not give up on a problem too early. When you finally make that progress, you really learn a lot.
It also means that homework problems which are too difficult are a terrible exercise, since the lack of progress will cause little learning.",math

By integrating both sides we get that [;F(x) \approx \frac{\sum f(S_i)}{#S} \cdot x + C ;], of course solving for C does not make much sense here, however if we ""drop"" f(x) to f'(x) we get that [;f(x) \approx \frac{\sum f'(S_i)}{\# S} \cdot x + C;]. Of course, now using the first method we can get an approximation for C which leads to: [;f(x) \approx \frac{\sum f'(S_i)}{\# S} \cdot \left(x - \frac{\sum S_i}{\# S} \right) + \frac{\sum f(S_i)}{\# S};].


This process is recursive, and it is noteworthy to point out that if [; \# S;] = 1 we have a taylor approximation. And that this idea is also easily convertable to approximate under an interval.",math

How would you calculate the speed settings?,erinmakenzy1,1625537214,"Okay so this is an actual problem that I deal with daily. I was in all honors math classes, but in no way consider myself a mathematician. In my job, I create truck routes  for deliveries and then the system I use creates timeframe for each delivery on the route based on the drivers' speeds that I set. Each driver is given a speed factor (the speed at which they drive) and a service speed factor (the speed at which they actually complete the delivery/installation). The average speed factor is .62 while the average service speed factor is 1.

If a driver drives faster than the system's average, I will increase the speed factor to something like .65 or .7. If they take longer than average to complete a delivery I would decrease their service speed factor to .8 or .9. 

I have access to data such as what the system estimated their service time to be based on the service speed factor I set it at and how long it actually took them. I also have the estimated driving time and how long they actually spent driving as well as what their estimated completion time was and what time they actually finished. 

I hope I explained that well, and I would be more than willing to answer any questions. I just KNOW there is a way to take all of this data and put it in an excel sheet and produce more accurate speed settings, but I do not even know where to start.

1332.0,32.0,Constructing the real numbers and consistency?,EulerLime,1625525149,"I've been thinking why is it necessary to construct the real number system from the rational number system. It was never clearly explained to me, so I'm wondering whether or not my thoughts below make sense. Any critiques would be welcome. 

&gt; My understanding is that when you start working with a mathematical theory/system, there are two things you could do: (1) write axioms that characterize your desired system and prove theorems using those axioms, or (2) construct your desired system in terms of some other system that you are familiar with. 

&gt; There is always a looming question that arises whenever you take approach (1): how do you know your list of axioms doesn't contain contradictions? My understanding is that even if your list of axioms prove consistency, that proof itself is subject to questioning, because it could be an outcome of the principle of explosion. It seems like the next best thing you can do is tie the consistency of your new system to the consistency of another system that you are more familiar with. 

&gt; In the case of real numbers, instead of trying to prove that the axioms of a complete ordered field are consistent (i.e. you cannot drive a contradiction), you can ""encode"" them in ZFC set theory by constructing reals in terms of rationals, rationals in terms of integers, integers in terms of natural numbers, and finally natural numbers in terms of set theory. Then because the real number system is ""encoded"" in ZFC, any theorem of the real numbers is in a certain sense a theorem of ZFC. Hence if the axioms of complete ordered fields are inconsistent, it would follow that ZFC is inconsistent. 

&gt; Although you can't have any absolute way to know whether complete ordered field axioms are consistent, by constructing reals in terms of other systems, you can relegate the question of consistency to the question of whether or not ZFC is inconsistent. If you believe ZFC _is_ consistent, then you can be assured that the axioms of complete ordered fields is consistent. 

My questions are, am I correct in this thinking? And are there are references (papers, books, etc) that talk about this in more depth? I'm very interested how consistency is handled.",math

Now, this is a very raw idea, but what if one could find similar elementary terms in other areas, namely in the humanities. I know what the first and a quite reasonable criticism would be: the real world is simply too complex to be reduced to terms and concepts.

This is true of the real world, but what if you could make up a world where different, but still somewhat recognizable rules are in place. What if you could make up a compelling place where terms and axioms are all that there is. It's in the behavior of this imaginary world, in the behavior of its natural laws, its creatures, its structure as a whole.

It would be a mathematical simulation of reality (or maybe not, if you give some wacky axioms). I know the idea is quite unrefined, but I was wondering did anyone have similar thoughts?",math

1337.0,37.0,Are one's mathematics talent and board games skills strongly correlated?,NDXP,1625517960,"Hello, kind of a soft question and it originates from an area where my self-esteem shakes; basically, I'm pretty bad at boardgames (think german games, those considered to involve strategy, an example could be Agricola), but I performed well in mathematics' classes (in an engineering degree) during university. 

**Main issue**: I often ask myself if my lack of skill in games could be an indicator that also my maths skill would have a not so high ceiling. 

I often think that's just an unsound line of thought, and there could be many reasons I'm bad at them, such as sort of lack of interest compared to other people I play with, playing them mostly for the social factor, and that actually any game (at least among those I know) is just somewhat boring from the mathematical point of view, mostly asking just for some optimization tasks, pattern recognition and mind games. I mean, the Kalman filter is way more interesting than making the longest road at ""The Settlers of Catan""

On the other hand, being this an area involving self-esteem, I cannot be sure I'm being rational and so I can't avoid to ask me if labeling such consideration as wrong could just be due to not wanting to admit that there could be a lot of math I'll never find approachable (up to now it hasn't happened), as if bad skill at boardgaming just imply I'm not talented enough

  
Indeed, as an additional question, would you think that any exceptionally talented mathematician surely would have a high win ratio at strategy games?

I have a BCs in Computer Engineering. My academic results weren't good (like top 50%). I wasn't performing particularly bad in math but still very average. I always loved maths theory, and the only exams I was able to perform really well were the oral parts of Calculus I and II and Linear Algebra. I always have been infatuated with theorems but was always pretty bad with practical stuff (I feel pretty slow at doing operations, like anything integrals to differential equations, etc. which always hurt my exam score). Now I am almost 30 and working in IT as a developer, my job is not super boring and I have a fair pay with which I could live my life (it's not that high but I don't feel like chasing money and probably won't for a while). 

I also aknowledge that scoring well at oral exams and bad at practice doesn't mean I can be good at math theory. I need to work on my weakness and I am already 'studying' (every now and then I pick random exercises on the internet like integrals/limits/series and test myself). I also have to say that the 'status quo' of having a math degree is something that attracts me - it is not the main reason for sure, but I have to be honest

**TL;DR**: I am 29, I like math theory, I was not the best student ever but I feel very motivated now. and although my love for the discipline, the status quo of a math graduate is part (but not the biggest for sure) of my motivation.

I'm trying to understand some basic math concept about polyhedral compilation. The general idea is pretty clear, but I'm not able to fully understand a basic detail about a definition.

After reading some paper etc, I've started to look at some tools to play with this kind of object.

I can see that the definition of Z-polyhedra (https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.129.6227&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf) is very similar to the one of basic integer set on the other paper, but I'm not sure that they are exactly the same.

Suppose you are a restaurant cook and orders are coming in. 

The time needed to prepare are as follow:

1. salad (5 minutes)
2. chicken (8 minutes)
3. noodles (10 minutes)


However, these orders did not come at the same time.

The noodles+ chicken were ordered first at 12pm, followed by the salad+ noodles at 12:03pm, then the chicken+ salad at 12:06pm.

You only have one stove, one cook and can only prepare one dish at a time.

Is there a way to determine the fastest way to finish cooking the orders?",math

1372.0,72.0,Why is Cantors Diagonal Proof (or something like it) necessary?,EroxESP,1625459360,"I'm not talking about utility here.  I'm missing some basic, core concept of why it isn't just an unnecessary middleman to a conclusion that equally acceptable without it?  


The way it was presented to me, the diagonal proof has every natural number in one column, and a matching random real number in the next. If you iterate every digit place of the real numbers sequentially, you necessarily end up with a number that isn't on the list, therefore real numbers are uncountable.  If you do the same to the list of the natural numbers, you (equally necessarily) also get a sequence of digits not on its respective list (probably 1 repeating forever, unless you scramble the natural numbers into a random sequence as well for a more intellectually appealing, but not fundamentally different, result) but this is somehow not a natural number because it must somehow now need to have an infinite number of digits (I guess before it had infinity-1 digits, which in this case would somehow not be infinity).

If I accept that, I'm still only accepting it because it is an inevitable and definitive consequence of natural numbers necessarily having finite number of digits and that real numbers are allowed an infinite number of digits.  If I accept these properties, then the conclusion of the diagonal proof is apparent without the exercise, and if I don't then the diagonal proof is ineffectual as its pretty clear that you equally necessarily get a unique string of digits on either side.

So what does the diagonal proof actually do?",math

So, what is the benefit of knowing a prime is “**digitally delicate**” or even “**widely digitally delicate**”?

You then count, starting from 1, through the entire space until you get to my number. Say you make 100 guesses per second. 

Now, the question I was thinking of was how long would it take, on average, for you to guess the number. My first thought was that since the number I chose is random, there are equal possibilities for it to be 1 or 1 000 000 000 000, 2 or 999 999 999 999 etc. So there is the same possibility for you to guess it right on the first try as it is for you to guess it right on the last try. This means that on average, you should take the time it takes to guess 500 000 000 000 numbers. Seeing as you guess 100 per second, that is roughly 158 years. 

The second way I thought of was to use this formula to find the amount of guesses it would take until there's at least a 50% probability for you to guess my number. I think it's called Bernoulli's theorem but I'm not sure. Anyways, that would be `(999 999 999 999 / 1 000 000 000 000)^x = 0.5 =&gt; log (0.5) / log ((999 999 999 999 / 1 000 000 000 000))`. The time needed to guess this many numbers is roughly 220 years.

I would've thought both these methods give the same time but they obviously don't. Am I misunderstanding something critical here? I have a feeling finding the average time to guess and finding the number of guesses to have a 50% probability that you'll guess the number are two different things and the problem is considering them as if they're the same.

My problem has to do with evaluating an equation with three unknowns (2\*a + 3\*b + 4\*c) and I have to calculate every single number the equation could evaluate to for any positive number a, b &amp; c. 

Computers suck at infinity so I need a way to evaluate this in chunks, which is why I'm here with a puzzle. If anyone has any suggestions on how to make this question clear, let me know, but in the mean time I will do my best.

Puzzle :

Take a grid of all the positive numbers and from (0,0) draw a line through each of its diagonals. So the first line would intersect co-ordinates, (1,1). Then the second line intersects (2,1)(1,2) then (3,1)(2,2)(1,3) ect.

I want the three dimensional version of this! I imagine this as a cube, with a plane traveling diagonally from the cube's corner. I.e. 111, (112 121, 211), (113 212 311 221 222 131 ect) ect

Reason:

This is my interactive way of dealing with this equation (2\*a + 3\*b + 4\*c). a, b, &amp; c will inherit the co-ordinates of this plane as it passes diagonally through the positive values of three space. (I hope)

1475.0,75.0,Introducing sandonometry,caughjut,1625292787,"So heres how it works and hear me out cause it gets crazy stupid and i want someone with math expertise to heko me go further.

When it comes to making sandwhiches there is a formula. If the word sandwich comes before anything else (example: sandwhich cracker, sandwhich cookie) then you know that the sandwhich doesnt actually have bread, but the bread has been replaced with whatever comes after the word sandwhich. 

But if the word sandwhich comes last you know that the sandwhich has bread (example: grilled cheese sandwhich, ham sandwhich). In this case, the first words describe the contents between the bread. 

Then there is this order: contents,  the word sandwhich, bread replacement. Which describes the contents of a sandwhich which has a bread replacement (example: pepperoni and cheese sandwhich cracker)

So we can make some laws here. 

S= the word sandwhich
s=1 sandwhich
C=the words describing the contents
c= all of the known contents of one sandwhich
u=unknown contents
R= the words describing replacements
r=the actual replacement for one slice of bread
B= the word bread
b=one slice of bread
N=the full name of the sandwhich
 
There is no commutative or associative property for sandometry 

With these rules and given the verbal formula we can express it mathematically like this:

S=(s=b+u+b) Unless R+S=N or C+S+R=N or S+C=N. 
if R+S=N then R+S=(s=r+u+r)
if C+S+R=N then C+S+R=(r+c+r)
if C+S=N then C+S=(b+c+b)

Using this you could get ridiculous combos such as:

if C¹=pepperoni and  and R¹=cracker and R² =cookie then (C¹+S+R¹)+S+R²= a pepperoni sandwhich cracker sandwhich cookie, so a pepperoni sandwhich cracker between two cookies, or r²+r¹+c¹+r¹+r²=s¹

you could write it more simply by saying that C²=C¹+S+R¹ and r¹+c¹+r¹=s² so you could write C²+S+R²=r²+s²+r²

or B+S=N in which case s=b+b+b or basically you have a bread sandwhich.",math

You have an NxN lattice. How many points can you select such that all pairs of points have a unique distance between them?

&amp;#x200B;

My progress so far:

\&gt;!Let x be the x distance between two points and y be the y distance. Then, WLOG, let 0 &lt;= x &lt;= y &lt;= N-1. With these conditions, we see that there are at most (N+1) choose 2 possible distances between points. Subtract 1 because we can't have that x = y = 0. Thus, if we have N+1 or more points, we will have to have (N+1) choose 2 distinct distances, which is more than the total number. This caps the answer for an NxN grid at N.!&lt;

I'm a UK mathematics undergraduate and have just completed my first year. There are a number of ways in which I'd like to try and improve before starting second year, but am not sure what would be the most effective way to do so. 

I feel like my main goal is to get better at maths in general in the sense of being able to solve problems more easily, as I've been doing okay as far as my degree is concerned but often with harder pure maths questions, I don't find it too easy to spot the ideas or to think through the problem in the most coherent way that leads down the route of finding the solution. As far as applied maths/mechanics/physics problems are concerned, when I find a problem difficult it is usually because of the setup being a bit weird/nonstandard or because of not having the right kind of physical intuition.

It seems as though practicing a lot would be the best way to improve in this aspect, but I do not know whether I should spend a lot of time studying the **content** in these topics in-depth to understand it as well as possible, or practice problems **exclusively** in the courses I am studying to improve at those specifically, or to look at **general problems** such as olympiad/Putnam style problems with the aim of improving general problem solving skills that apply to a wider range of things.

The sort of goals I have at the moment are to gain a solid understanding of core concepts in analysis, linear algebra, abstract algebra, applied fields etc., and to get better at understanding how to approach problems in a more ""natural"" way and be able to build intuition behind things more easily.

(I think it was Bayesian statistics and it was such a rabbit hole that I never came out of) . I imagine anyone reading this would find this extremely silly, but that's what happens when you leave a minds to wander on their own I suppose: they lose their track. I, like the idiot that I am told no one about this. not about what I was studying, not about how or why I stopped, not about my depression not about anything.

Sorry for the long rant but I turned 17 only a month ago or so. It took me a while but now I think I realise that the fault wasn't in me but in my approach! now I'd like to get again into the field of data science and DL and it's prerequisite math, and I don't want what happened to happen again. I would appreciate any advice on how to fix my mindset and how to study more efficiently and be less detrimental on my mental health:).",math

1505.0,5.0,Here's a more math-oriented prisoner riddle (sort of) I just thought about,smartinvestmentsonly,1625250650,"Imagine you're a prisoner and you're incarcerated with your N-1 friends (so there's N people) , you just found out that in a few weeks the guard is going to kill exactly half of you, and there is nothing you can do about it, however you concoct a plan such that the remaining half can escape.

Let's say the plan is really long and detailed and it would be hard having everyone remember all of it.

What's the best way to distribute the plan among your friends such that you have the best chances of recovering the whole plan.

And how does it change depending on N

For exemple if N=2 you would need both people to remember the whole plan but if N=10000 you can cut the plan in phase A and B and have everyone remember one or the other as it is very unlikely that the 5000 survivors all remembered the same phase of the plan.

Can we find for each N the best distribution of the plan such that the probability of recovery of the plan is greater than 90%, 95% or 99%

You can cut the plan however you want, as long as every part of it is remembered by at least one survivor you escape.

I'm really curious about this, although there might be a very obvious answer that i just haven't seen.",math

Note that it is written from the view of an analyst.

I like to think that mathematics as this sort of hierarchy of the depth at which we understand a concept.

At the beginning there is only naive/free/pure geometry. Imagine shapes and forms without any understandig and any way to measure them. Spaces without structure

Then comes Analysis. We describe these geometrical concepts with functions and relations, and we can find result about these objects.

What I mean here is that you can do things like describe the shape of a circle with a formula, find its area, use calculus etc. You can describe complicated systems with differential equations.

You can also do easy things like count apples and bananas and add their sum.

As you find out more and more things you encounter certain concepts that are very interesting. These could be things like Polynomials, the Fourier transform or Function spaces.

Now comes the step where you invent algebraic objects: For an interesting concept, you try to find a \*minimal set of axioms that makes it work/happen/tick"".

In the case of polynomials, one could say that a ring is the smallest structure where polynomials work. A ring has everything you need to reason about polynomials abstractly and nothing more.

For the Fourier transform, which is usually seen as a very typically analytical object, we have found out that Locally Compact Abelian (LCA) groups are just about sufficient in axioms to make the Fourier transform work. This is called pontryagin duality and lets you show very general results (in rather ""algebraic"" fashion, I would personally say) about the concept of Fourier transform.

Function spaces are my strongest example here: A Banach Algebra/C\* Algebra is pretty much a set of axioms which gives you just about enough to work with to do typical functional analysis. The definition already looks algebraic too, with it mostly being, well, an algebra.

There is also the field of ""algebraic analysis"". I don't really know it very well, but I got the impression that part of what they are doing is trying to find a minimal set of axioms to add to their rings and modules so they can do differentiation and calculus.

This pattern is my main point.

Note that under this view what we usually consider algebraic topics such as integers, primes, rings and fields and groups are just examples of concepts that were easier to understand, so we quickly find minimal sets of axioms to talk about them. As a result we can find out much deeper results in these areas. As Algebra expanded it wanted more and we got algebraic geometry. I think the varieties studied in algebraic geometry would have been considered quite analytic objects 200 years ago. But as we understood them better and better they were swallowed by Algebra.

Meanwhile analysis is so ""ugly and messy"" because it deals with very complex objects - such as partial differential equations  - and since we can't neatly break their behaviour down into a few axioms yet things are quite hard. 

I guess what I am saying is that in the future differentiation might be considered a much more algebraic object.

I'll leave you with another speculation: Category theory is idea act of forgetting about the objects at all and only remembering how they interact with eachother. Just like Algebra is slowly swallowing Analysis as knowledge proceeds, Category is slowly swallowing Analysis, turning neat objects consisting of a set with a few axioms into abstract categories of anonymous points and arrows.

This is just some a bunch of fun speculation though - consider it a mathematical fan fiction :)",math

1574.0,74.0,DMD is better without Ergodic Theory and Koopman Operators,AcademicOverAnalysis,1625163573,"Hello everyone!

If you have been following my posts, then you will know that I've been posting the lectures for the classes I've been teaching during the pandemic up on YouTube at [http://www.thatmaththing.com/](http://www.thatmaththing.com/). This includes my class on *Data Driven Methods for Dynamical Systems*.

One of the big thrusts of this class has been to demonstrate my group's perspective on problems like the *SINDy algorithm* and *Dynamic Mode Decompositions*. For the former, we showed how integrals can be used to not only gain robustness against sensor noise, but also to define a data driven inner product space on collections of nonlinear dynamics through their Liouville operators over particular RKHSs.

For Dynamic Mode Decompositions, we have been taking this a lot further. Our approach has been completely independent of most of the rest of the literature, where we lean on function theoretic operator theory, Liouville operators, and reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces in lieu of Ergodic Theory and Koopman operators. The tools developed using this perspective are more flexible and cover a broader range of nonlinear dynamical systems. Moreover, it gives us proper convergence theories for DMD that aren't available through the Koopman formalism.

I'm working on a few videos diving into the convergence theory right now, and I am trying to hash out the story here. Maybe you guys can help me frame this?

**To make the advantages my group's perspective clearer, let's talk about what we need from our dynamics for the Koopman/Ergodic Theory perspective.** Koopman operators are composition operators that are defined with respect to the discretization of a continuous time dynamical system. Koopman operators are operators posed over function spaces, where members of these spaces are called observables. If we have dynamics that are not forward invariant, dynamics such as \\dot x = 1+x\^2 which gives tangent functions with finite escape times (vertical asymptotes), then *the resultant discretizations of the dynamics will have holes in them*. This is problematic, where holes in the composition function for the operator means that it isn't defined over the domain of definition that the observables are. This means that when we try to compose those discrete dynamics into an observable, the result is that we don't have a function in the function space anymore. So to be sure of well definedness of the composition symbol, *we need that forward invariance property*.

This forward invariance rears its head in another way, when we look at the Ergodic theorem. Ergodic theory helps us find eigenfunctions for the Koopman operator in L\^p spaces (Birkhoff in L\^1 and Von Neumann for L\^p with p &gt; 1) by looking at averages over long run behavior of the trajectories. *We can't integrate to infinity unless the trajectory actually exists out to infinity*, and hence, this is where the forward invariance comes in.

(Forward invariance is usually verified using a Global Lipschitz condition, but it can also be shown using other tools for nonlinear systems theory, such as Lyapunov theory. Eventually, I'll get into proper nonlinear control theory on my channel, but I've been having too much fun with the data driven material.)

So what are the drawbacks here? Forward invariance is a fairly strong condition on your dynamics, and its requirement with Koopman operators means that *even if we observe a segment of a trajectory of a system that isn't forward invariant, then we can't leverage that data using the Koopman formalism*.

Another issue that comes up is that DMD algorithms centered around Koopman operators build finite rank representations that converge to the Koopman operator in the Strong Operator Topology. **SOT convergence does not guarantee the convergence of the spectra, which is problematic with DMD methods that use spectral theory to design a model for a dynamical system.**

In a sense, this is the best you can do here. Koopman operators are rarely compact, and if you read my paper ""Anti-Koopmanism"" [https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.00106](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.00106), then you can see that for a given fixed function space, these operators are rarely even bounded. There we demonstrated that for the Gaussian RBF space, the exponential dot product kernel's space, the polynomial kernel's space, and the Pailey Wiener space, the only bounded Koopman operators are those with affine symbols, which is a far cry from the general nonlinear systems that most imagine using the Koopman operator for.

**We have been working hard to remove these assumptions and achieve convergence of DMD theories.** First we introduced occupation kernels to determine a finite rank representation of Liouville operators (Koopman generators in the special case of forward invariant dynamics), and *this allows us to circumvent Koopman operators altogether and work with systems that are not forward invariant*. I have a whole series of videos going over occupation kernels and their relation to DMD, and most recently I posted a video that modifies Liouville operators and occupation kernels to obtain a DMD algorithm for control affine systems. You can find that manuscript here: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.02620.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.02620.pdf)

***Finally, we can also achieve norm convergence of finite rank representation made using our methods to the Liouville operator, which in turn gives properly convergent DMD routines.*** The trick? We use different domains and ranges for our Liouville operators, and in doing so, we can show that these operators are compact. This leverages some ideas from classical function theoretic operator theory in the disc, and we extended these ideas to R\^n. We gave a specific example where this works, and it works for many other spaces too, in this paper: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.02639](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.02639)

From our point of view, this is the ultimate piece of evidence that the use of sampling theory, Liouville operators, and RKHSs over ergodic theory and Koopman operators is the best way to go for Dynamic Mode Decompositions. *DMD is a spectral method and is performed using finite rank approximations of dynamic operators. If you want the spectra of the finite rank operators to be close to the spectra of the dynamic operator, then you absolutely need that the dynamic operator is compact.* Compactness is achieved by letting go of the semi-group property of Koopman operators, and by stepping away from this requirement, we can achieve a convergence DMD routine.

Over the next several weeks I'm going to build up to the theory in that last paper on my channel. I'm eager to hear everyone's take on it. This is a big field, and their are a lot of people working on these problems.",math

1647.0,47.0,Meaning of PDE with Discontinuous Boundary Conditions,VicsekSet,1625077503,"A couple of years ago, I took a course in differential equations (primarily aimed at engineers), and in the last portion thereof, we learned how to solve certain PDEs/boundary value problems via Fourier series. I understood (and still understand) the method perfectly well, but I recall that we occasionally saw boundary conditions that were discontinuous, and I don't know how to interpret the differential equation under those conditions (after all, it seems that the derivative would be undefined, and thus so would the differential equations!) For example, we might consider a problem in which two metal rods at different temperatures are brought together at time t = 0, and (given appropriate conditions on the other ends of the two rods) be asked to solve for the temperature distribution at an arbitrary time. Now, when I took that course, we would blindly find all separable solutions to the heat equation, represent the initial distribution as a Fourier series, use our understanding of the separable solutions to see how each frequency component evolves over time, and represent the time-dependent solution via an infinite series/via Fourier synthesis. But at t=0, when the heat distribution was discontinuous, what did the differential equation represent? Correspondingly, what exactly has been accomplished (mathematically speaking) in this solution?

(At this point, I have taken courses in undergraduate analysis and algebra, as well as point-set topology, so please aim your explanations at someone with roughly that degree of mathematical maturity and knowledge.

1649.0,49.0,Newton's second law as an axiom,Ihsiasih,1625073590,"I've loved this way of thinking about Newton's second ""law"" for a long time. Newton's second law is a pair of definitions and axiom, not a theorem. 

**Defns**. A *force* is the derived unit mass \* \[acceleration\] = mass \* length / time\^2. The *net force vector* of an object o is the force **F**\_o = m\_o **a**\_0, where m\_o and **a**\_0 are the mass and acceleration, respectively, of o.

Note: by definition, changing an object's net force vector changes that object's acceleration. This is not a ""law"", but a consequence of the definition of an object's net force vector.

**Defn**. Let o\_1 and o\_2 be any two physical objects. If there exists **a** != **0** such that the force **F**\_{o\_1 -&gt; o\_2} := m\_1 **a** can be superposed onto o\_2's force vector, then we say that *o\_1 can apply the force* **F**\_{o\_1 -&gt; o\_2} *to o\_2*. If o\_1 actually does apply this force, we say that *o\_1 applies the force* **F**\_{o\_1 -&gt; o\_2} *to o\_2*.

**Observation**. Clearly, there are many examples of objects applying forces to each other. I, having mass, can accelerate a box (it also has mass) by ""pushing"" it.

The above dispells the notion that Newton's second law is some concrete universal fact (some ""law"") that the genius Newton struck upon in a lightbulb moment. It is a definition. However, it is not ""just"" a definition. It is a very clever, well chosen definition.

\- **You** ***could*** **use ""mass times velocity"" instead of ""mass times acceleration"".** After all, why not involve velocity? Doesn't ""mass times velocity"" kind of sound like a ""push"", too? Yes; in fact, you *can* think of mass times velocity as being another type of push: the formal word for it is *momentum*. So, really, ""force"" and ""momentum"" are kind of just two buzzwords that are connoted with pushing. You could say that ""mass times acceleration"" is a ""force, type 1"" and that ""mass times velocity"" is a ""force, type 2."" (This is nonstandard terminology). Then you would have **F**1 := m**a**, **F**2 := m**v**, **F**1 = d**F**2/dt, etc., instead of the standard notation **F** := m**a**, **p** := m**v**, **F** = d**p**/dt, etc. The relationships are the same in the end!

\- **But... it turns out that speaking of ""mass times acceleration"" is convenient for thinking about relativity.** 

Consider two ""reference frames"": one frame could correspond to the perspective of a runner on the sidewalk, and another frame corresponding to the perspective of someone who is sitting in a car that's driving past you at a faster speed.

Consider this fact ([proof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictitious_force#Mathematical_derivation_of_fictitious_forces)):

* Two ""frames"" that are accelerating relative to each other will disagree on the mass times acceleration of an object that is also accelerating relative to those two frames (since each such frame induces *fictitious* mass times accelerations on the other).

On the other hand...

* Two ""frames"" that are traveling at constant velocity relative to each other will agree on the mass times acceleration of an object that is accelerating relative to those two frames. 

Let's assume that we will do physics in the special case where we are in a frame that is traveling at constant velocity relative to some other frame. (I.e., we have two frames traveling at constant velocity relative to each other).

If we want to talk about ""pushes"" in this situation, then it makes sense to talk about changes in velocity, since an object with unchanging velocity corresponds to yet another constant-velocity frame! From this relativistic perspective, the ""pushes"" that are in some sense external to the nice world of constant-velocity frames- the *different* ""pushes"" that are begging to be observed from that nice world- are those whose frames are not elements of {the set of all frames traveling with constant velocity}. That is, the ""interesting pushes"" are those that involve acceleration, not velocity.

\- **And, for modeling purposes, it seems that ""mass times acceleration"" is a better interpretation of ""push"" than ""mass times velocity"".**

The equations of motion for a particle experiencing linear air resistance are determined by the ODE -k**v** = m**a**, k &gt; 0. The motion described by this ODE isn't completely accurate (since we're assuming linear air resistance), but it's not that bad!

On the other hand, if we had defined ""force"" to be ""mass times velocity"", then the equation of motion would be -k**v** = m**v**, which has no solution when k != m. That doesn't seem right.

This argument against ""push"" meaning ""mass times velocity"" is really dependent on our human intuition, since intuition is what produces the model in which the air resistance force is -k**v**; intuition produces an air resistance model that doesn't make sense for ""force equals mass times velocity"".

\- **Definitions should match intuition... but what is our intuition for ""push""?**

Concerning ""pushes,"" it's really hard to figure out what our intuition actually is!

Considering the relativistic perspective together with the air resistance example, one can start to convince themselves that change in velocity (acceleration), not change in position (velocity) is really what most accurately ties into our intuition of ""push.""",math

1668.0,68.0,Is This A Correct Way To View Probability?,doxiMAN_MAN,1625044137,"Recently I started learning the continuous versions of all of the discrete probability laws/functions, with CDFs and PDFs.

And over the course of the course, we said a couple of things that we can't prove because we don't have the tools for them, and that at first didn't make sense to me intuitively, for instance the law of total probability for the continuous case, and why we can move from the discrete to the continuous case using the same formulas.

But recently I've developed this intuitive formula when looking at probability:

P(X=x)=f_X(x)dx

and this seems to make total sense to me, because the probability of being dx away from x is the area under the density function over that area. So as dx goes to 0 we get the probability of being dx length from x, which is just the probability of being x.

and now I see the law of total probability just as a continuous sum of all of the P(X=x) (=f_X(x)dx), and this seems to stem quite naturally from the discrete case (although each one is technically 0, if we look at it from a sense of the area under f in every interval of radius dx around x, having a continuous sum of those values won't necessarily be 0).

Is this a right way to view this? If not (I'd like to know why ofc), and then how else might I understand the law of total probability (and others that are similar, like LOTUS)?

1696.0,96.0,Conjecture on 3x3 magic squares of squares,van2z,1625007708,"[Magic squares of squares](https://plus.maths.org/content/os/latestnews/may-aug10/magic/index) are interesting to me because of their simple nature. All you need is 9 integers that square and add to the same sum in all directions.

You can pretty quickly derive that the sum of opposite sides/corners equal 2 * the center square. And the total sum equals 3 * the center square. This allows for pretty substantial optimizations when developing an algorithm to test out many magic squares.

As a programmer, I devoted the last few days of computation time to trying to find 3x3 magic squares of squares. I computed every combination with the center square from 1 to 1,000,000^2.

I found this interesting piece of information:

**The most amount of squares that have integer square roots, are 6 out of the 9 squares.** And these can usually be found with a center square being less than 1000^2.

After testing this up to a center square of 1,000,000^2, I conjure that there will never be more than 6 integer square roots.

But I don't know why. Here are a few ideas I went through:

Here is a simple example or square roots:

---|---|---
121|11|149
141|111|69
49.4064773081425|156.59182609574486|100.00499987500625

Notice, there are 2 rows of integer roots. I thought, maybe there is a maximum number of integer root rows? If any other cell here were to be an integer root, then there would be 3 rows. Two horizontal, one vertical (and maybe one diagonal too).

It is possible to construct a magic square layout where you would have 7 integer roots with only 2 rows:

   111
   101
   011

1 is where there would be an integer root, 0 is where it is not an integer root.

Running my algorithm with this design, however, I was not able to get matching integer roots in this configuration. It only works if I limit it to only 6 integer roots.

So for some reason, you are limited to only 6 integer roots within this magic square, regardless of rows.

I wish I can use this information to somehow do a proof by contradiction or something, but I can't figure out how to formulate that 6 integer roots, which don't necessarily add up to a row, are the maximum number of integer roots in a magic square of 9 cells....",math

Hi. For those of you who work on a non math related job but still want to keep learning math. How do you do it?

In my job I need lots of problem solving skills but to be honest the actual math that I need don't go much further than percentages and calculating proportional quantities. It's a bit of a shame because I loved learning math, and I actually was enrolled on a masters degree intending to follow with a phd, I had the idea of becoming a university professor but once I realized that was very unlikely even if I was extremely good (I was just ""average"") I left graduate school.

I enjoy my job and learned I can still be happy doing other things, but I really miss learning ""high level"" math. How do you guys do it? I have tried going through a book myself but it feels like there is no purpose so I never get to do much. I have tried doing Project Euler problems, I really enjoy those and they keep me really entertained, but still it's not exactly what I want. What I would like for example is to learn about elliptic curves and modular forms, and how they are related which I understand is key for FLT. Or I would like to understand. Or I would like to learn about algebraic geometry in a structured way, I never had that at uni mostly because it's outside of the scope I guess. But I never find the way to do that successfully, it's like a miss a direction so I can't really do it.

I hope this kind of post is allowed. I need a pointer into the right direction.

I am working on the analysis of very inhomogeneous samples which contain very different organic substances. I cannot directly compare two samples with their chemical composition as they vary too much. But: I realized that two samples with similar origin hav similar properties (boiling point, polarity etc..).

Thus I have compiled a large list of components with 10 parameters each. I would like to arrange the data in a (hypothetical) space. My idea is, that similar structures should lie ""closer"" to each other than unsimilar. After arranging the points I would like to calculate a surface or 'cloud' around my points with the idea that similar samples should have similar 'cloud shapes'.

My question would be: How is this approach called? I tried googling, but using only amateur terminology did not get my very far. What should I google to get maybe an introduction to this kind of approach, or what kind textbook should I consult. I do have a university access, so feel free to recommend technichal/scientific literature.

1780.0,80.0,Why the axiom of choice does not seem as intuitive as it's always first made out to be.,SmartPrimate,1624929191,"Apologies if there's any misunderstandings here, I'm just an entering sophomore math major with no experience with formal set theory beyond an intro proofs course. Yet for months I've been puzzling over the axiom of choice on my own time, granted I tend to be biased towards philosophical topics and the foundations of Mathematics are ripe with overlap there. I should qualify that I definitely wouldn't count myself as a constructivist, as denying laws of classical logic such as that of excluded middle has always been absurd to me. 

To start with, the 4 most ""intuitive"" equivalents of the axiom of choice in my opinion would be:

1. The standard version provided that makes use of the choice function.
2. The law of trichotomy for sets, so between any two sets, either there exists a bijection between the two, or a bijection between one of them and a smaller subset of the other. This might appear more ""common sense"" than the last, however both are only ""intuitive"" insofar as you get that a function itself, especially over infinite sets, need not hinge on the concept of being constructible/having a rule/pattern/formula, but rather more accurately hinges on the concept of a mapping, or in other words, a collection of ordered pairs, whether infinitely long or not. This was my mistake initially, and it's an important distinction to make as the former understanding was even the basis of Lebesgue's objection not only to AC, but weaker versions like ACC.
3. For any family of nonempty disjoint sets, there exists a set that consists of exactly one element from each element of the family.
4. The cartesian product of a collection of non-empty sets is itself always non-empty.

Yet, as ""intuitive"" as these may sound, it was never hard at all for me to get why they actually aren't, shared by a common theme between all of them. I want to first clarify that to begin with, none of this will bother those of a formalist bent, the only ones who might take issue with this at all are mathematical Platonists, whose philosophy probably borders somewhere along the lines of Math being the ""study of whatever is potentially observable."" What all of these do rather have in common is that they thus all hinge on the idea of an ""actual infinity"" being observable, which is touching on the sides of the philosophical debate between potential and actual infinities. Of course, while we know a ""potential infinity"" can be a thing specifically through the usage of patterns, the most bare bones example being ""just keep adding one,"" there are only two way the concept of ""actual infinity"" could be justified.

One is if you legit count an infinite amount of objects through time, which is impossible because to finish or ""end"" that process would contradict what infinite even means, ""without end"" by it's definition. So the only other alternative to justify the concept of an ""actual infinity"" is via admitting the possibility of a \*simultaneous\* infinite observation. Of course, we know we can't do this with our naturally finite observation, and so at the very least it makes sense to be uncomfortable to the point of agnosticism on it, and not at all explicit denial as some people presume when they refute by bringing up the consequences of the negation of choice, something I think people are in overall much more agreement on about not admitting as an axiom and very rarely argue for. But ultimately, this axiom not only hinges on such a simultaneous infinite observation being possible, but it guarantees it for ALL sets just by statement alone. This is where it's non constructive nature comes from, inherent within itself and not simply just from a few unintuitive consequences (non measurable sets and Banach-Tarski paradox).

Of course, even for those who choose to be agnostic about it, it's not at all a useless axiom, in fact if we suppose a simultaneous infinite observation could be a thing, it's rather a fun one to play around with it. The keyword there however is \*suppose\*, since in respect to the Platonists who question it, it simply does not have the same \*objective\* truth value as the other axioms for to the aforementioned reasons. That being said, there is a rebuttal to this that could be used to make it really seem ""intuitive""/common sense. Even the definite integral when it was first discovered, before Calculus was even made rigorous, hinged on ""intuitive"" notions like infinitesimals, with a sort of representation in mind of an area being an infinite stack of 1d lines/infinitesimal width rectangles in a finite 2d space, or a volume being an infinite stack of 2d/infinitesimal wide cross sectional areas filling in a finite 3d space, etc, a clear example of a simultaneous infinite visualization being at least conceivable. That being said, the catch in this example, is that it's clearly limited only to sets up to the cardinality of the continuum, whereas full axiom of choice applies to all sets. Yet unlike full choice which I'm agnostic about, this is something I'm genuinely considering as a ""self evident truth"" as I do with the rest of the ZF axioms.",math

Factorize n and perform the same substitution for the factors. Once you reach a situation where you get a 1, replace that with the nullary function ""p()"". The resulting string contains only the following symbols: p, (, ), \*. Remove \* as it's redundant. Finally, substitute: ""p("" = 1, "")"" = 0.

The first few examples: 2 = 10, 3 = 1100, 5 = 111000, 7 = 110100, 11 = 11110000, 13 = 11011000, 17 = 11101000, 19 = 11010100.

Example reconstruction: 11011000 = p(p()p(p())) = p(p(1)\*p(p(1))) = p(2\*p(2)) = p(2\*3) = p(6) = 13.

I came up with this concept when I was trying to create a base-independent base naming system. The names would eventually get stuck on latin names for primes, and latin is base 10, so I had to simplify it even further. Choosing the p function resulted in these binary codes.

First heard the term a few years back, and I now find myself applying it to studying for my mathematics courses.

(A brief example of metacognition is my realization that I have trouble with building habits and following through with things. Recently, I had made an effort to start going to the gym. But, I realized (just recently) that in high school, the common pattern was that every time I had tried going to the gym, I'd go for two or three days, and then burnout. I also know that habits take around a month to start forming. So my new goal at the start of working out wasn't to put too much effort into the workout, but to just go to the gym 5 out of the 7 days per week for one month; even if it just meant doing a single workout for 5 minutes. And it actually worked, and I've been going to the gym ever since.)

Back to the post: Now that I'm done with my school's core classes, my math courses are getting much more complex. The normal protocol for me for understanding curriculum involves me reading over the chapter, taking light (physical) notes, and then, usually, the numerical examples help clarify the theorems and definitions. One of the very first definitions in Calculus I that I was introduced to a few years back, I remember struggling with for a very long time.

`Let f(x) be a function defined on an interval that contains x = a, except possibly at x = a. Then     lim x → a f(x) = L, if for every number ε &gt; 0 there is some number δ &gt; 0 such that |f(x)−L|&lt;ε whenever 0&lt;|x−a|&lt;δ.`

Lately, as I further progress through my current textbook (advanced linear algebra), later chapters' theorems/definitions/etc., are based off of previous chapters' material; and I'm struggling to intuitively understand what they mean. Although, numerical examples and proofs, especially, help clarify those theorems. But I want to more quickly understand the theorems just by reading them. Another problem for me is that I'm a fast reader—and often get ahead of myself—and don't have that great of a memory. Combined with mathematics notation (namely letters), I have trouble interpreting the theorems/letters with their actual meaning. When working with classmates, they seem to grasp the material much faster, but oftentimes, I find myself correcting them when it comes to actual application and numerical examples.

I'm wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences to this with learning math. Do/did you *just* understand math jargon? If so, did it come natural, or did you get better at with time? I want hear your experiences with metacognition as it relates to math, and the best way you've optimized learning.",math

And of course, included in this visualization is that of non infinitely long subsets of the reals that still have an uncountable number of elements, giving way in some sense to the ability to conceptualize simultaneous infinite mappings. Think of the image students first learning calculus often have in mind of a volume being an infinite stack of 2d or infinitesimal wide cross sectional areas filling in a finite 3d space, etc. Even if such a notion is non rigorous and in practice we use the limit process instead, it's still obviously at least conceptualizable. Where the restriction comes in of course is that this analogy is only applicable to the continuum, as we have no equivalent intuition in that specific sense when it comes to larger sets. 

Knowing this, it seems to me that for those bothered by full axiom of choice, the same axiom but limited to a choice function over an infinite family of sets indexed indexed by a set only up to the cardinality of the continuum, rather than for a set of any cardinality, or alternatively, the law of trichotomy but again, only applicable to sets up to the size of the continuum, etc (I am assuming those statements are both equivalent, correct me if I'm wrong though), that that might be an appealing alternative to some people as far as ""intuition"" goes.

So with that in mind, I was wondering what are the consequences of this alternative, namely, is it still provable with it that the reals are well orderable and/or that the powerset of the reals is linearly orderable?

Correct me if I phrased anything wrong, I haven't taken complex analysis yet.

Something that 3blue1brown introduced me to was the idea of visualizing complex functions as transformations of a grid in R2. You can see the context of my question in the original thread, but  my question involves this visual transformation of the complex function f(z)=1/(z-1):   
[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7ffOhqsn1g)

1/(z-1) is the first term of the Laurent series of Zeta(s). Visually this transformation (or the output of the function) appears to be symmetrical around the real and imaginary axis. I wanted to know how exactly do you prove that the output of a complex function is symmetrical around the real and imaginary axis? To start, f(z) is a rational function, so it is holomorphic everywhere except at s=1. This means that f(z)=f(z)*, which means that the function is symmetric around the imaginary axis (This applies to the Riemann Zeta Function as well). Showing that it is symmetric about the imaginary axis feels weird to me. For functions of a single variable, f(x) would be symmetric if it was odd, but that focuses on the symmetry over the inputs of a function. It feels weird to think about how to show that the output of a function is symmetric. One could say that f(1-z) = -f(z), but I feel like there should be a way to show that the transformed grid is symmetric around the imaginary axis without referencing the 1-z input. Thoughts?",math

Except for some loose ends, we now have a complete list of which compact complex manifolds admit Kähler–Einstein metrics in all dimension up to complex dimension 3. 

In my [previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/lnuqn6/resolution_of_the_finite_generation_conjecture/) [posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/o31o5h/the_unreasonable_effectiveness_of_physics_in/), I talked about the problem of finding canonical metrics on complex manifolds, a problem going back all the way to the uniformization theorem about the existence of constant curvature metrics on Riemann surfaces.

Those posts were concerned mostly with the *theoretical* problem of finding canonical metrics, and centre around the the **Yau--Tian--Donaldson conjecture**, which proposes a purely algebro-geometric condition under which a projective manifold admits a canonical metric, a constant scalar curvature K\""ahler metric. This condition is called K-stability, and for example every smooth Riemann surface is K-stable. In this sense the conjecture can be seen as a higher dimensional analogue of the uniformization theorem.

In the special case of Fano manifolds, the YTD conjecture is a theorem proved by Chen--Donaldson--Sun in 2012, and fully answers the question ""under what conditions does a compact complex manifold admit a [Kähler–Einstein metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%A4hler%E2%80%93Einstein_metric)?"". For a slightly longer discussion of the significance of this problem and why we might try and study manifolds from this perspective, see the introductory sections of my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/lnuqn6/resolution_of_the_finite_generation_conjecture/).

The recent work I described essentially concluded that *in theory* we can now completely solve the problem of when a manifold admits a Kähler–Einstein metric, by reducing it to checking an algebraic condition. However, *in practice* it is actually quite difficult to check K-stability of a Fano manifold, and until now we had only completely described the existence of Kähler–Einstein metrics up to complex dimension 2.

# Which manifolds are Kähler–Einstein? 

The Calabi problem asks: which compact complex manifolds admit Kähler–Einstein metrics? As I previously described, this problem can be split into three cases depending on the *sign of the first Chern class c_1(X)*. 

* In the case when c\_1(X)&lt;0, the so called *general type* case, every smooth general type manifold admits a Kähler–Einstein metric. This is a theorem of Aubin and Yau.

* In the case c\_1(X)=0, the so called *Calabi--Yau case*, every smooth Calabi--Yau manifold admits a Kähler–Einstein metric. This is a harder theorem than the general type case, and was solved by Yau (hence the names).

* In the case c\_1(X)&gt;0, the so called *Fano case*, not every smooth Fano manifold admits a Kähler–Einstein metric. There is an algebro-geometric obstruction called K-stability, and only when the Fano manifold is *K-stable* (or *K-polystable* if it group Aut(X) of holomorphic automorphisms is a positive-dimensional Lie group) does a Kähler–Einstein metric exist.

So which complex manifolds *are* Kähler–Einstein? 

Well by the general existence results of Yau and Aubin--Yau, in the general type or Calabi--Yau case, every compact complex manifold admits a Kähler–Einstein metric. So what's left is: which Fano manifolds are Kähler–Einstein?

Now we can answer this question abstractly: ""the ones which are K-stable."" But what about explicitly? Can we actually find and describe every single Kähler–Einstein manifold?

# Which Fano manifolds are Kähler–Einstein?

Since not all Fano manifolds are Kähler–Einstein, to find the ones which are we have to in principle go through and actually check every single Fano. Now fortunately for us, by some general theory about the boundedness of smooth Fano manifolds (note: Caucher Birkar won the Fields medal in 2018 for proving this same reuslt for *singular* Fanos), in each dimension n there are only ever finitely many classes of Fano manifolds. These **deformation classes** represent continuous families of Fano manifolds which have mostly the same algebraic properties, and can be algebraically deformed into each other. 

* In dimension 1 there is exactly 1 Fano manifold, the Riemann sphere CP^(1). It turns out that CP^(1) has no deformations at all (it is ""holomorphically rigid""). The standard round metric is a Kähler–Einstein metric on the Riemann sphere, so that completes the problem of finding Kähler–Einstein manifolds in complex dimension 1.

* In dimension 2 there are 10 deformation classes of Fano manifolds, the del Pezzo surfaces. The basic example is CP^(2), which admits a Kähler–Einstein metric, the [Fubini--Study metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fubini%E2%80%93Study_metric). In general every other Fano 2-fold is a blow up of CP^(2) at finitely many points, except for just one example, CP^(1) x CP^(1). Of all these 10 classes, Tian proved that a smooth del Pezzo surface is K-polystable if and only if it is *not* a blow up of CP^(2) in one or two points. By the CDS theorem (or really, Tian's earlier proof of the same result for del Pezzo surfaces), this means every Fano surface in 8 out of the 10 families is Kähler–Einstein, which completely answers the question of which Kähler–Einstein manifolds exist in complex dimension 2.

* In dimension 3 there are 105 deformation classes of Fano manifolds, which were found by Iskovskih and Mori &amp; Mukai in the 1980s and 90s. Over the last several years the tools to explicitly check K-stability have improved significantly with the development of **valuative K-stability** by Fujita--Odaka, and the invention of the **delta invariant**. Many of the 105 classes had been previously checked for K-stability (indeed 26 of the 27 classes that were K-unstable were already known). To complete the search, Cheltsov et al have gone through every single class and checked whether the *generic* representative is Kähler–Einstein using these new tools, and found that in 78 of the 105 classes the generic representative is K-(poly)stable, so admits a Kähler–Einstein metric. Since K-stability is an open condition in deformation classes, this tells us that **almost all Fano manifolds in 78 of the 105 classes are Kähler–Einstein**. In some cases, such as when the Fano threefolds have infinite automorphism groups, we can actually say *all representatives* are Kähler–Einstein. The loose end is to come up with a precise condition under which the non-generic members of the remaining 34 families are Kähler–Einstein. They conjecture that in 27 of these families, every single representative is Kähler–Einstein, and of the remaining 7 there should be a precise criterion (in terms of a certain geometric invariant theory criteria) to determine which representatives are Kähler–Einstein. 

* The classification of Fano manifolds in dimension 4 and 5 is not yet complete, and is the subject of an ongoing project called **Fanosearch** by various algebraic geometers, primarily centred at Imperial College. Alessio Corti dubbed this a project to find the ""[periodic table of shapes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_table_of_shapes)."" The number of classes of Fano manifolds in higher dimensions appears to grow rapidly, so this will involve extensive computer search and classification. Fanosearch is using tools such as mirror symmetry to classify these varieties in dimension 4 and 5. In theory one could then try to repeat the same program of dimension 3 to check which of these Fano 4-folds and Fano 5-folds is Kähler–Einstein, although the process does require a certain amount of *by-hand* work, so it remains to be seen if this could also be computationally automated.

#TL;DR

The upshot is this: We can (except for a few loose ends) describe exactly which compact complex manifolds have Kähler–Einstein metrics, the most uniformly curved and canonical metrics, in complex dimensions 1, 2, and 3. The setting of dimension 3 represents the culmination of about 30 years of hard work classifying the deformation classes into 105 types, coming up with a checkable criterion for when a Kähler–Einstein metric exists, proving a very hard theorem about this criteria, and then checking every single class by hand. 

Personally I think this demonstrates why complex manifolds are so interesting: they have *just* enough structure that we can actually classify them exactly. In general we can only ever hope to get very coarse or very incomplete classifications. For example the problem of classifying *all* Einstein manifolds is much more difficult and probably intractable (although the physicists would love if that was wrong).",math

I have discovered lots of cool results along the way-- but the aspect I am most interested in tackling is functions with natural boundaries and functions with 0 radii of convergence. Here I am stuck though since I am not sure the right way to define continuation in these cases. With functions that only have isolated singularities, methods such as recentering Taylor series show that the resulting continuation will be unique, and so in those cases, the idea of an analytical continuation is well defined. My hope is that you will be able to help me find to what extent the idea of analytical continuation is ill-posed in the cases of natural boundaries and 0 radii of convergence, or at least point out flaws in what I have considered so far.  I don't have access to professors, and I don't have all that much formal education, so let me know if this entire idea is non-sense as well.

&amp;#x200B;

# 0 radii of convergence

For this case, I have developed this equation: 

[Eta is the Dirichlet Eta function. Note that this formula simplifies considerably in the case where f\(n\) is a power series instead of a Laurent series](https://preview.redd.it/htjuumlnho771.png?width=1466&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6eb44137a989104cab8cc8f1f490f692e99c3841)

This says that if we happen to have an analytic equation, f(n), which matches the coefficients then we can continue the function using this equation. The last line I'm a bit less sure of-- but it states that the negative values of the coefficients in f(n) *should* agree with the Laurent series, but this might be false in some edge cases. (Here is a link to some examples of using this equation: [https://www.desmos.com/calculator/opdxwa0qfa](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/opdxwa0qfa))

One example of using this equation is for this series.

https://preview.redd.it/zdb1s5ibgo771.png?width=516&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f3335cbe6c2b7fc9e16bacfa1eef18aaf8aa486a

This series does have a 0 radius of convergence but using Borel summation this can be shown to converge to 

https://preview.redd.it/sg5ivmvrgo771.png?width=418&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a73df2d7a44d9823041ecd5cea58b2af4744311d

This agrees with the equation I gave for negative values when they both converge (i.e. when x&lt;-1/2)

https://preview.redd.it/31irhjp4ho771.png?width=516&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b916e7b007fe683d53ee4a236062662459f37411

For 0 radii of convergence, my thoughts are that maybe it's possible to sort of analytically continue the partial sums of the series. By this, I mean that the partial sums of series with 0 radii of convergence tend to actually approximate the function very well. For instance, with the sum of the alternating factorial function, we have

[Red is the first 15 terms of the partial sum. Blue is the continuation that Euler got of this function.](https://preview.redd.it/gf2ejcrwkq771.png?width=1306&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6a464774c4fb2f4fe9cc548035394e0cd41718db)

What is interesting here, is that these partial sums actually agree very closely with the blue function until it all a sudden dips downward. And in fact, one method of 'analytically continuing' a partial sum is to apply a sufficiently smooth cutoff function. Doing this to partial sums of the alternating factorials gives something that converges all the way past 1.

https://preview.redd.it/8ukyhktonq771.png?width=628&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=102078b78081f742b6fe2d27124911b375a2e3ba

To what extent would something like this be unique? What kind of way would I start to rigorously defining the idea of partial sums being analytically continued (I'm thinking maybe doing something with the L\_1 norm)?

One nice result of the first formula is that many f(n) happen to either be even or odd, and so this gives a reasonable way to guess the equation of the extension of certain functions. With gap series with k being odd, guessing that f(n) is even and has no negative terms in its power series actually leads to a reasonable continuation of those gap series. We end up with a continuation that agrees at all orders of derivatives at every angle that is a rational multiple of pi. Along every other angle, the gap series and the continuation both diverge when |z|=1. Would an analytical continuation that continues the function along with a dense set of rays, and is analytic itself be unique? My thought is that along each ray, one could multiple a non-analytical smooth function with 0 derivatives of all orders at the unit circle and get a new continuation. But somehow, these functions would have to push their non-analytic-ness into just that unit circle, since the function would have to analytic elsewhere. I supposed I'm trying to answer the question of whether or not a dense set of rays uniquely define a function if it has an infinite number of singularities when |z|=1.

Yesterday, I discovered an interesting formula; but I'm not sure if I have rediscovered this or whether this has any value or not. I found this very interesting and finally decided to share this in this subreddit  as my knowledge in mathematics is not noteworthy.  


*If,* 

a, b, c forms an arithmetic progression and c &gt; b &gt; a then,

we can write,  


**a****^(2)** **+ b****^(2)** **- c****^(2)**  **= (5ab - 3bc) / 2**  


the proof is very easy, so I don't think it's appropriate to write it here.  


The equation looks beautiful right? But there are some other things that I have noticed working with this equation. 

Now my questions are:

* Can you name a mathematician or refer to some works that sheds some light on such ideas?
* Does this formula looks interesting to you? What will be your advice for my further investigations?

Now, onto my actual question, is there a classification of functions/expressions that maintain their value upon changing the variable by a constant?

I'd be greatful if /r/math people could help me out with formalizing the proof for induced EMF below! It's really math technicalities, not physics stuff, that is holding me up there.\]

Does someone know of an article or some notes that prove the logical dependencies (as in implication and if-and-only-if) between the various Maxwell equations and ""Maxwell lemmas""? (An example of a ""Maxwell lemma"" is the Biot-Savart law).

While I'll settle for iff's that relate Maxwell equations and Maxwell lemmas if I must, it would be nice to be able to derive some of the Maxwell equations or Maxwell lemmas from first principles (like maybe a [continuity equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuity_equation#Electromagnetism)?). I also prefer longer, more intuitive ""discovery-style"" arguments that are geometric if possible to ""efficient"" arguments that start with nonobvious hypotheses or use magical machinery like delta functions.

Here's what I have so far. This also outlines the kind of content I'm looking for.

* (**Coloumb and Gauss laws**). [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss%27s_law#Deriving_Gauss's_law_from_Coulomb's_law) already details the relationship between the Coloumb and Gauss laws: Coloumb's law and E field has superposition =&gt; Gauss's law, and Gauss's law for a stationary charge =&gt; Coloumb's law.
* (**Faraday's law**). First principles (*or possibly more assumptions I'm not aware of*) =&gt; induced EMF is negative time derivative of magnetic flux. Applying Stokes' theorem to this formula for induced EMF gives the integral form of Faraday's law. **I suspect that the implication ""EMF formula =&gt; Faraday"" is actually an if-and-only if.**
* (**No monopoles**). I don't know how to prove the ""no monopoles"" Maxwell equation, which states that div(B) = 0, or equivalently, that magnetic flux around any volume is zero.
* (**Magnetostatic Ampere's law**). Magnetostatic Ampere's law &lt;=&gt; Biot-Savart law. (See proof below).
   * (**General Ampere's law**). It seems to me that the general (magnetodynamic) Ampere's law can be motivated as follows. First, take the divergence of the magnetostatic Ampere's law and apply the continuity equation for current density to obtain the false statement that charge density is always constant. So magnetostatic Ampere's cannot be correct. The magnetodynamic version of Ampere's is obtained by taking the time derivative of the differential form of Gauss's law, commuting d/dt with the div operator, integrating over the volume's boundary, and applying Stokes' theorem. **Is there any first principle from which Biot-Savart can be derived?**

Not Maxwell equations, but maybe are necessary ""Maxwell lemmas"":

* The integral formula for induced EMF. **Would really appreciate help making some steps in this rigorous.**
   * Pucell's proof of this goes like this. Consider a surface S that emanates like a balloon from the loop of wire C. Now consider the definition of magnetic flux,  Φ(t) = ∫\_S **B** . d**a**. In the infinitesimal amount of time dt, the loop of wire C moves to become a new loop, C'. We now consider the surface ""S + dS"" that is the result of ""augmenting"" S by a ""rim"" dS, where dS is chosen such that S + dS has a boundary of the new loop C'. The magnetic flux at time t + dt is Φ(t + dt) = ∫\_{S + dS} **B** . da = ∫\_S **B** . d**a** \+ ∫\_{dS} **B** . d**a** = Φ(t) + ∫\_{dS} **B** . d**a**. Thus the change in magnetic flux is dΦ = int\_{dS} **B** . d**a**; the change in magnetic flux is the flux on the ""rim"" dS. *This makes intuitive sense, but does anyone know how to formalize this idea of S moving to S + dS? Maybe a homotopy of curves?* Then we have dΦ = ∫\_{dS} **B** . d**a** = ∫\_C **B** . ((**v** dt) x d**s**). **What???** I can see how d**a** = (**v** dt) x d**s**, but **how do we go from a surface integral to a line integral without using Stokes' theorem?** After this we just ""divide by dt"" to obtain dΦ/dt = ∫\_C **B** . (**v** x d**s**) = ∫\_C (**v** x **B**) . d**s**. (This all can be rigorized with limits, so no problem).
* Ampere's law and Coloumb gauge\* =&gt; integral formula for vector potential.
* Helmholtz decompositon theorem. (No physical assumptions necessary for this- it's a vector calculus thorem. It's just not mentioned alongside the divergence and Stokes' theorems).

(\*\*Proof outline for Magnetostatic Ampere's law &lt;=&gt; Biot-Savart law). I prove integral form of magnetostatic Ampere =&gt; Biot-Savart by using the integral formula for the vector potential A of a thin wire to compute the magnetic field as B = curl(A). I prove that Biot-Savart =&gt; integral form of magnetostatic Ampere holds for a circular loop by using Biot-Savart to derive the magnetic field strength around an infinite wire; after this, integral form of magnetostatic Ampere's law follows quickly by definition. **I'm not sure how to show Biot-Savart =&gt; magnetostatic Ampere in the general case (maybe more assumptions are needed).**

\* The Coloumb gauge is the assumption that div(A) = 0. Assuming the Coloumb gauge implies (via vector calculus identities) that curl(B) = laplacian(A).",math

I've sort of accepted the definition of, they are just a bunch of elements in the Clifford algebra built out of an even number of tensor products of unit vectors. But what the hell does that mean? What do they ""do?"" do they act on stuff? When I think of tensors, another topic I had difficulty understanding once, I now have the snappy line ""(p,q) tensors are elements of a vector space of maps that eat p vectors and spit out q vectors in a way such that they are linear in every argument"", this immediately tells me what they are and what they do. I haven't got a similar sort of intuition for spinors yet.

Another thing that confuses me is globalising this construction. Most things from differential geometry turned out like, we have this construction on a vector space V, now replace V with TM\_x and use a vector bundle to get smoothly varying versions of what you just built (i.e. forms, vector fields). When I see lecture notes about spin structures instead of saying ""a spinor field is a section of the spinor bundle"" which is what I'd have expected I've seen

""A spin structure on a principal SO(n) bundle Q -&gt; X is given by a principal Spin(n) bundle P -&gt; X"" 

I won't lie I genuinely have no idea what this means, is it like the case of  ""a tensor transforms like a tensor"" where it sounds useless until you already understood the concept and then becomes helpful?

1974.0,74.0,"Is there a ""common sense"" argument for the axiom of choice?",izabo,1624700301,"TL;DR: What is the most simple argument you know of for why we should accept the Axiom of choice?

To explain what I mean:

Back when I learned intro to set theory, I was amazed by how weird the axiom of choice is. However, when I tried talked about it with other people, even math students, they seemed to not really get why it's so weird. So I told them that the AoC is used to proved the Banach-Tarski theorem, which even non-math people will agree is pretty wild. 

However, when my intro to set theory prof taught us about the Banach-Tarski theorem, he said this (paraphrasing): 
&gt;This isn't that weird. Banach-Tarski uses the infinite number of points in a sphere to construct two copies of the same sphere. But you already know about an example of an infinite object that can be divided into to two copies of itself, the natural numbers.

So damn, he's got a point. Banach-Tarski is not that wild after all. 

So I went looking for other weird consequences, and I found this one on stack exchange IIRC (this is after some modifications by me and my friends to make it a bit more ""down to earth""):  

&gt;Let's say there are countably infinitely many numbered boxes in room, and in each box there is a note with an integer on it. You're allowed to open and look in as many boxes as you'd like (even infinitely many). Your goal is to guess the number inside one box before you open it. 

With the AoC you can make an algorithm that would guarantee an arbitrarily high chances of success (the original version is about 100 people having a combined 100% chance of success, but it requires communicating an unaccountably infinite amount of information between them which feels a bit dirty to me). Solution at the end. 


I like this because it is simple enough a statement so that even non-math people could understand it, and even the solution is not that complicated. and now I noticed I have a simple argument for why the AoC is really weird, but I have no simple explanation for why AoC is really reasonable!

I know we don't have to accept AoC, but without AoC math would be much more restrictive and arguably less elegant. But aside from making mathematicians lives nicer, why should we accept AoC? Is there a simple common sense argument that even a non-math person could understand for why we should accept AoC?

Also, what is your favorite argument for why the AoC is bonkers? do you know of an even simpler one?

Solution:

 &gt;!Let's do it for 50% success. Define an equivalence relation on infinite integer sequences s.t. two sequences a_n and b_n are equivalent if they are exactly the same from after some finite point. Pick a representative for each equivalence class and define a function as such: f({a_n}) = the lowest k such that from a_k on, a_n is the same as the representative of its equivalence class.

&gt;! Now divide the boxes into to two sequences, let's say the even numbered boxes and the odd numbered boxes. Let's call the number inside the nth odd numbered box a_n and call the number inside the nth even numbered box b_n. Either  f({a_n}) =&gt; f({b_n}), or f({a_n}) &lt;= f({b_n}) (or both). By symmetry it's clear we have at least 50% chance that f({a_n}) =&gt; f({b_n}).

&gt;!Open all the odd numbered boxes to find out a_n and then find f({a_n)} = k. Open all even numbered boxes except for the first k. We now know all b_n for n&gt;k, so we can find the representative of the equivalence class of b_n. If f({a_n}) &lt;= f({b_n}) then b_n is the identical to it's representative from before k+1. So we have a 50% chance b_k is the same is the kth element in the representative. We can now guess with 50% chance of success the content of the kth even box without opening it. 

&gt;!For a bigger chance of success, divide the boxes into N sequences instead of just 2. open N-1 of the sequences and get their f's, and take their maximum as your k. The chances that the Nth sequence has an f bigger then the maximum of all the others is less then 1/N so you can get 1-1/N chances of success by the same way.",math

(which is translated to: 'A point is a monad which acquires a position').  
 

Up to Aristotle, the term for point in geometry was ""stigme"", which  means ""instance"". This is because the point - when marked - is not meant  to be understood as divisible. By the time of Euclid's Elements, the  term used was *semeion*, which connotes that the position marked is of interest (semiotics has this root).  
 

Might be worth noting also that semeion, by the 2nd century AD, in  literature can mean a sign, which practically would not make the  specific *position* of it be of primary importance.  
 

Another reference of interest is to the debate about primacy of position  or object in a position - a point presented by Zeno. Some modern  writers (such as DeLong) argue that Zeno may have been arguing against  what (roughly 1,5 centuries later) Euclid decided to set as a  restricting rule of a whole being always larger than its parts - DeLong  mentions this due to a discussion of sets and powersets, where a whole  often is smaller than (operations of) its parts.",math

Let's begin with the generic normalized quadratic x\^2 + bx + c = 0, with the associated normalized quadratic formula x = (-b+-sqrt(b\^2-4c))/2a. Let (h,k) to be the vertex. From basic calculus we have that h = -b/2 and we plug this into the original quadratic to obtain k = c - b\^2/4a. Solving for b we obtain that it is equal to -2h and use substitution to get h = c - h\^2 =&gt; c = h\^2 + k.

I remember seeing something about how you can just count all the integers given infinite time, you start at 0, add 1, repeat forever.

I also remember seeing that you couldn't do that for rationals, because some rational numbers are written with infinite digits, like 1/3, 0.3333333...

So my question is, can't you just list all the rational numbers by doing

- list every integer
- for every number A in the list of integers, and for every number B in the list of integers again, add A/B to the list of all rationals.

I'm wondering if maybe there are rationals that you can't write as an integer over an integer.

- Each new one I find has one more term on each side of the equation. Does this pattern continue indefinitely?
- It seems similar to Pythagorean theorem. Is it something like a 3,4,5 triangle in higher dimensions or is it completely unrelated?
- Does it extend to a larger set of numbers (like cubes following the same pattern)?

Essentially it asked that given a string with length 1, if cut into 2 pieces and those pieces formed into squares what is the maximum area enclosed by the sum of the two squares. So, pretty basic introductory max/min optimization problem.

Except that it actually requires literally no calculus to solve! If you model this as A = (x/4)^2 + ((1-x)/4)^2 the x2s cancel out and you’re left with 1/16, the answer. I understand that this problem was used to teach the idea of optimization, but it’s things like this where a simple problem is unnecessarily overcomplicated that get on my nerves way more than they should.

Another pet peeve of mine is that often in these problems maximizing area with two cutouts, in fact nearly always, you find that the solution is actually not to cut the string at all. This seems all fine and dandy until you realize that the question always asks, “if a string/rope/wire is cut into two pieces.” So really, your solution is incorrect because you violated a given of the problem, in fact your answer should be a limit as one of the perimeters approaches 0.",math

I decided to apply [digital roots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_root) to [balanced ternary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balanced_ternary) numbers to see if anything interesting happens.

Base 10 | Balanced 3 | Digital Root
:--:|:--:|:--:
0|0|0

5|1TT|-1
6|1T0|0
7|1T1|1
8|10T|0
9|100|1
10|101|0

The digital root is 0 for all even numbers. The interesting one here is when we get -1.

Starting from 0, here are the first few list of numbers that get a digital root of -1:

I recently applied to a teaching position at a university that i just graduated from. The deadline for the application was the beginning of last week.

I'm told for jobs outside academia it's fine to ask about the status of your application, but I don't know if that's the case in academia. So my first question is: is it inappropriate for me to ask about this?

My second question is who I should ask. When I applied online I left my application unfinished for a few weeks while I edited my teaching statement further (perfectionist and anxious) and the associate chair sent me a courtesy reminder of the application. I've had him as an instructor and over the years I have gone to him several times for help, so I would not be coming as a stranger if I asked him.

2123.0,23.0,Opinions on Axler? Should determinants be deferred when learning/teaching linear algebra?,blungbat,1624467079,"Sheldon Axler's book, *Linear Algebra Done Right*, banishes determinants from most of the exposition. Axler also makes the case for this approach in his article [Down with Determinants!](https://www.maa.org/sites/default/files/pdf/awards/Axler-Ford-1996.pdf).

Ultimately, I think I need to read the book (or at least the article) to judge the approach, but before I invest the time, I am curious what r/math thinks. The introduction to Down with Determinants! isn't super convincing to me. Here are some of Axler's main arguments and my initial reactions:

* **Determinants are unintuitive.** This wasn't my experience; I found them to be one of the *most* concrete handholds when I was learning linear algebra.
* **Determinants are unnecessary for most of linear algebra.** I'm willing to buy this if the determinant-free proofs are elegant.
* **Determinants are unnecessary for undergrads in general.** Maybe if you stick to a very particular curriculum, but as a curious student, I ran into determinants along all kinds of side paths (e.g., studying matrices over the ring of integers, or lots of stuff in combinatorics). Also, Axler says the *one* place determinants do matter to undergrads is in changing coordinates for multiple integrals. That seems like a very narrow way to frame things -- if you understand determinants as volume scaling factors, then this is merely one natural application.
* **Determinants are often impractical for actual computation.** I'll concede this, but it's irrelevant since the question is what role they should play in theory.

Thoughts? If you've read Axler, what are some good things about it?",math

This shape is an important counter-example in topology.

There was a recently a discussion on twitter, sparked by [this thread](https://twitter.com/jtbrazas/status/1406652385263501319). In it, Jeremy makes the claim that the the space in question was named ""Hawai'ian earring"" because the space itself is exotic, and people also view Hawai'ians as exotic. If that claim is true, then the terminology Hawai'ian earring would be culturally appropriative, as it was named only because white people though Hawai'ian culture sounded fun. I find the claim dubious; I think that the shape is called a ""Hawai'ian earring"" because it resembles a multi-hoop earring, and someone thought such earrings were associated with Hawai'ian culture. However, I can find no evidence that multi-hoop earrings are Hawai'ian, so I ultimately agree that the name Hawai'ian earring is nonsensical at best, and offensive at worst.

My questions to everyone else are,

1. What do you think about the appropriateness of calling that space a Hawai'ian earring?
2. What would be a better name? Previous names I have heard are ""infinite earring"" (like in this [Scientific American article](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/roots-of-unity/a-few-of-my-favorite-spaces-the-infinite-earring/)) and ""shrinking wedge of circles"".",math

Let the four traces be [;\pi_1;], [;\pi_2;], [;\pi_3;], [;\pi_4;], and the trace property [;T;]. Suppose the following assumptions hold:
1) traces [;\pi_1;] and [;\pi_2;] satisfy the trace property [;T;],
2) traces [;\pi_3;] and [;\pi_4;] do not satisfy the trace property [;T;],
3) all four traces execute the same low operations,
4) traces [;\pi_3;] and [;\pi_4;] execute execute the same high operations

5) traces [;\pi_1;] and [;\pi_2;] are low-equivalent and the initial states
of [;\pi_3;] and [;\pi_4;] are low-equivalent.
Then, TPOD is satisfied if [;\pi_3;] and [;\pi_4;] are low-equivalent.

[They then display the equation in the paper using notation](https://i.imgur.com/oz4CttY.png).

2165.0,65.0,[Question] Can I determine a margin of error in this hypothetical scenario?,BubbRubb4Real,1624414347,"Hello everyone,

First time poster here. I hope my question makes sense enough to where it is easy for you guys to answer.  It makes sense in my head but sometimes I have issues expressing my thoughts coherently. 

I like to make up hypothetical questions and think it over while I am at my job.  I was reading about margin of error and I see that using margin of error is more so meant for polling and surveys instead of my hypothetical scenario. 

My question was if someone wanted me to take the average of 10,000 pages worth of numbers that had 100 numbers per page.  And say they gave me a very short amount of time to do it.  My thinking in this question would be to take a random assortment of pages and determining the average of those pages. The number would be determined based on how much time I had. Say if I had an hour or two to do it I would only take the average of about 10 pages whereas perhaps I think I could get 100 pages or more done if I had the day to do it.  

My thinking is that, in polling and surveys, how you attain your samples is more important than the actual number of samples you poll. If I were to take a number of pages the most randomly that would produce better results than the sheer number of numbers I average. 

Would there be a way for me to answer the person that gave me the task “The average of these 1,000,000 numbers is X with a Y degree of certainty.” ?  I hope that my question at least gets some people’s minds going. I’d greatly appreciate any helpful answers.  And PLEASE correct me if I am wrong anywhere in my question.",math

Currently I'm adding support for regular polygons, and I'm working on deriving a formula for the **area (A)** of a pentagon if given its **side length (s)**. Using some information found on Wolfram Mathworld, I came up with the following formula for such:

\`\[; A=\\frac{5s\^{2}\\cot\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{5}\\right)}{4} ;\]\`

However, the pentagon calculators found on Google and Omnicalculator chose to simplify the cot function into a radical for a formula that looks more like this:

\`\[; A=\\frac{1}{4}\\sqrt{5\\left(5+2\\sqrt{5}\\right)}s\^{2} ;\]\`

I want to make sure I present the most clear and mathematically correct formulas that can be applied to all n-gons on the site, so I had a few questions on the subject:

* Should trig functions always be converted/simplified to radicals expressions in formulas like these, even if it makes the formula significantly longer?
* Is a tan function in the numerator preferred over a cot function in the denominator?
* When should a formula be formatted to multiply the terms by a fraction (like in Google's formula) as apposed to dividing them by an integer (like in my formula)?
* How important is it to rationalize square roots and other radicals out of denominators when presenting formulas like these, given today's computer calculation methods?

Semantic bullshit second name for Logical operations?,VirtualPlay7571,1624409475,"Boolean algebra is the stupidest non-existent piece of theoretical trash to ever be endorsed by the mathematics community. Logical combinations with input/output operations were well known and utilized in mechanical computers BEFORE Boole even published his ( academic attempt at taking credit for something many talented engineers already knew about ). Similarly, most of the Early computers after Boole were designed by people who had never even heard of the guy.

The modern attribution of boolean algebra to the birth of computing is nothing more than non-technical historians inventing connections that never existed.

Boolean algebra is nothing more than input/output charts. Scientists have experimented with Unary, binary, ternary, quaternary and continuous-value analogue with complex operations that fall far outside the scope of ""Boolean"" shit.

The first ternary calculating machine was made out of wood by Thomas Fowler in 1840. This was before Boolean algebra in 1850. Charles Babbage's differential machine Utilized what is classified as ""Boolean Algebra"" way back in the 1820's.

So I would really like it if people could please stop mentioning cool sounding terms like ""Boolean algeba"" in an attempt to impress others. it isn't impressive, it isn't clever, Boole didn't invent it, and it

 is the worst way of describing basic logic. Fuck all those academics that get erections when ever they find another way of baffooning others into thinking they are smart, by memorizing technical jargon

2185.0,85.0,"Me and my friend spend 2+ hours trying to find the exact area of Sephiroth's Up-Smash, and both feel like such idiots after the fact because of some cool stuff about how disks and crooked radii work.",thatgameideasguy,1624391250,"Hey everyone, I know this is kind of a weird topic, but this really started to nag at me after playing a Sephiroth online a few hours ago. I figured it'd be an interesting problem to parse, what with how Sephiroth holds his sword at a right angle as he rotates it about his shoulder. Plus it'd just be interesting to find out how big such a big move actually is. 

So, me and my friend got to sketching, and came up with a pretty accurate diagram of the move's shape. After some wizardry at finding congruent angles and right triangles, we were able to find the area for such a weird shape. However, while working it through, namely when finding the area for the yellow portion, I noticed that when finding the actual disk's area (the square of the outer 5.44cm radius minus the square of the inner 1.6cm radius), I found that I just ended up using the length of the sword (5.2cm for our model). I didn't think anything of it at the time and kept on going, getting a final area of about 54.09cm\^2 for our model. 

On a whim though, I just plugged in the sword's radius into the area of 5/8 of a circle (the area encompassed by Sephiroth's Up-Smash) and we were both dumbfounded to find that it spat out basically the exact same thing. I went through our work, threw together a proper formula based on what we did, put it into an online calculator to get an exact area and yeah, exactly the same as (5/8)pi(5.2)\^2. 

All our work was literally for nothing, and that's hilarious. I figured having the radius be bent at that quirky angle to make such an odd disk would be interesting to puzzle out, and it was, but we were laughing for ages to find that out. Even now though, my mind keeps pinging back and forth between thinking it's totally intuitive and thinking that it makes no sense at all. That such a weird shape is simply equal to a circle with a radius of that bent part is just so crazy, and I wanted to share that discovery process with you all. 

Plus, I also just wanted to clarify - does the radius being bent off course like that really have no effect on the area of the rotated shape? Even after extending it out with some empty space in the middle? In the example we used, Sephiroth was holding his sword at basically a perfect right angle, so would bending the sword at a different angle impact the area rotating it makes? 

tl;dr - Sephiroth's sword is pretty heckin big, we did a lot more work than we needed to to find the area it covers, the disks formed by crooked radii are weird and surprisingly the same area as a regular circle, is this consistent across all disks formed by rotating bent radii?

What if the drain at the bottom was plugged and you were locked in the shower space to drown? I was wondering if you could drink it at a rate to survive until you're overcome by starvation or not. And no, you can't turn off the shower.

So, to calculate this, let's estimate the shower to have a volume of 3 cubic metres or 3000 Litres/793 Gallons. Taking in mind the average shower head flow rate of 9.5L/2.5gal per minute. This means the shower will fill to the brim after \~5.3 hours. The average human can drink 1L/\~0.26gal per hour at most without risk of water intoxication. The showerhead spits out nearly 10 times the recommended hourly drinking amount for humans in a minute. So if you drink as much as you can, you'll decrease the hourly flow rate by 0.18%. You'll most likely drown in this situation unless you somehow drink yourself to death or something. No matter how much you drink, your stomach is no match.

TL;DR: If you're in the shower and the drain is sealed off and you're locked in, you won't be able to drink the water nearly as fast enough as you need to stop it from reaching the top. You'll die in about 5.3 hours from drowning.",math

It seemed to go fine until now at page 33 in a prove inverse cuts under addition are defined as the following (greek letters always refer to right-hand side sets; the compliments of which are marked by a bar - i am not using greek alphabet as latex doesn't works in firefox):  

-a := {-r : r is element of a; r =/= max(a)}. 

Well, but shouldn't it be instead

-a := {-r : r is element of compliment(a); r =/= max(compliment(a))} (*)?

I mean how can a right-hand side set even have a maximum if it is (at least how i understand cuts) not bounded from above? If i instead define -a with the compliment(a) all seems to work (in my math newby brain at least). With definition (*) you get a right hand set which defines the inverse under addition to the real number defined by a cut alpha ...

... but i MUST be wrong as this is the 3rd edition and taking a quick look at the english translation this ""mistake"" is also made here. So it isnt a mistake, but i am not getting something. The possibility that alpha denotes a left hand set is out of question as the authors explicitely stated a on page 32 that in the following secetions greek letters always denote right-hand sets and also in the same proof they state ""s=/= max(compliment(a))"" which makes sense, but to me seems to be in conflict with their inverse cut definition.

In lecture nine he goes over linear approximations, which are a concept in Calculus I always skimmed through as I felt like it was pretty trivial. Prof Jerison introduced some nice shortcuts for different functions, and also the formula f(x)~f(x0)+f’(x0)x, at values close to x0. I have never used that formula in my life, and I wonder if I should.

Alright, after that long winded context dump, I’ll phrase my question clearly: I always did linear approximation by finding the derivative of x0, realizing that was the slope of the tangent line, and then plugging that slope in for x0 to find b. Then I use that auction for linear approximation. Will this continue to work, or should I put effort into learning to use this formula?",math

My Engineering and Physics peers have never liked hand-graphing. They're long and tedious problems that end up bleeding time on exams, and they can easily go and program the problem in their choice of programming environment. 

My Engineering professors phased out hand-graphing these problems for the most part besides phase diagrams, and even then we're given them. My physics professors ended up moving qualitative analysis to our labs and kept the lecture all about quantitative problems, and if they did want to do a qualitative analysis they'd have the problem pre-done in some environment to show us. They stopped doing these by hand as well. 

My math professors are the only ones that remain on this hand-graphing course, and even complain that students aren't great at it due to terrible preparation in pre-req courses. 

So I have to ask, why is it still being taught when computers can graph them better with more accuracy? I'd imagine if you understand the quantitative part about the equation, you'd be able to analyze the graphing portion with ease.",math

ii) A probability measure on R^n is said to be diffuse if it is non atomic and singular with respect to Lebesgue measure. Is the following statement true? A subset S of R^n is mesoscopic if and only if there exists a diffuse measure μ such that supp μ ⊆ S.

My gf is in her 3rd year of BSc of Math. she studies in a very good and high-level college. some of her peers are very good at math (a few of them IMO medalist level) so the pressure is high. first year was too tough for her because she had no reliable background in math and almost everybody were better than her. But she kept pushing and now is an average student there.

The problem is she wants to be the best (in top 10% of the class for instance) and pursue a PhD. she says there's nothing she loves more than math but she often fails to put enough effort into her studying. She, on average during a semester, studies 1 hour per credit each week, which is too low considering her fundamentals are quite weak in comparison to top students and even then, I know for a fact that top students study 2-3 hour/credit.

She sometimes complain that she's not smart enough, that she's dumb. but often acknowledges that she has to study more but she says she can't do it. it's like her maximum effort is 4-5 hours of studying in a day. even then, she doesn't do it consistently. when she can't study or get bad grades or see people much better than her, she goes to a depressed mood and cries.

I don't know what to do anymore. She's in a vicious cycle, she doesn't study enough and doesn't get good results, she gets sadder and loses motivation to study.

- every player (you and mr K) have 9 cards, 3 for every symbol of paper, rock and scissor.
- both start choosing one card. We follow then the classic rules of the game.
- if there is a tie, both continue to play a card until one win.
- the loser of every round choose how many cards will be played the next round, 1, 2, 3 or 4.
- if there are more then one card for player in the same round, all the cards that have a copy on the opponent side will be discarded (i.e. S S S R vs P P S R result in S S vs P P).
- every winning card worth one point.
- if, at the end of a round, there is a tie, the loser of the previous round continue to choose the number of cards to play.

It's based off of this website - [The Proof is Trivial](http://www.theproofistrivial.com/) - which generates random disparaging remarks about how easy the problem you're attempting is.

The game requires at least three players, and works as follows:

-----

1) One player is chosen at the start to be the ""judge."" They then use the website above to generate a random nonsensical mathematical object, for example ""A prime language whose elements are clopen taylor series.""

2) Every other player has a set amount of time to come up with a rigorous definition of that object. (For example, explaining what it could mean for a language to be prime and a Taylor series to be clopen). Bonus points if you can come up with a non-trivial example.

3) The judge listens to each player's explanations and chooses a winner (in the style of Apples to Apples, there is no concrete criteria - just whichever option the judge likes best).

4) The role of the judge transfers to the next person, and play continues.

---

The game often leads to either very interesting mathematical discussions or just absolutely wild BS, both of which are very entertaining. You can play for points and crown whoever has the most after N rounds as the winner, or you can just play for enjoyment. If you have enough people, using teams of two instead of individual players is also fun.

2358.0,58.0,The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Pythagorean Tuning,munchler,1624118814,"**tl;dr:** [Pythogrean tuning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_tuning) produces a sequence of relative frequencies. Why do the first seven notes produced this way form a semi-regular ""diatonic"" scale?

Using 3/2 as a base (a ""perfect fifth"" in musical terms), raise it to the powers of -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, and 3:

* (3/2)^(-3) = 8/27
* (3/2)^(-2) = 4/9
* (3/2)^(-1) = 2/3
* (3/2)^(0) = 1
* (3/2)^(1) = 3/2
* (3/2)^(2) = 9/4
* (3/2)^(3) = 27/8

For each such value, ""normalize"" it by multiplying or dividing by 2 until the value is in the range \[1,2\]:

* 8/27 → 32/27
* 4/9 → 16/9
* 2/3 → 4/3
* 1 → 1
* 3/2 → 3/2
* 9/4 → 9/8
* 27/8 → 27/16

Sort the resulting values:

* 1
* 9/8
* 32/27
* 4/3
* 3/2
* 27/16
* 16/9
* 2

This sequence of relative frequencies (with 2 on the end to complete the scale) is called ""[diatonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diatonic_scale)"".

Now for the magic part: If we compute the ratio of each value to its predecessor in this sequence, we get a semi-regular pattern of notes within an octave:

* 9/8 : 1 = 9/8
* 32/27 : 9/8 = 256/243
* 4/3 : 32/27 = 9/8
* 3/2 : 4/3 = 9/8
* 27/16 : 3/2 = 9/8
* 16/9 : 27/16 = 256/243
* 2/1 : 16/9 = 9/8

Only two ratios appear: 9/8 (a ""whole step"") and 256/243 (a ""half step""). This repeating pattern of half steps separated by two or three whole steps is what makes the scale diatonic: `W h W W W h W W h W W W h W` ...

But why should this pattern appear? Is it just a mathematical coincidence, or is there a deeper reason? The normalization function seems particularly interesting, mathematically speaking: It's like a modulo operation, but over rationals rather than integers. Intuitively, it seems like there's something about the interaction between this function and the 3/2 ratio that produces a pleasing pattern, but I don't have the mathematical skills to explain it. Can anyone shed light on why this works out so nicely?

**Edit**: Just to be clear, I’m not asking a musical question about why the diatonic scale sounds good. I’m asking a mathematical question about why a specific procedure produces a repeating diatonic pattern of “whole” and “half” step ratios.",math

This appeared in my [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/lnuqn6/resolution_of_the_finite_generation_conjecture/) about the same area, which was more concerned with significant advancements in the algebraic-geometry side of the theory.

This paper jumped out to me as a somewhat incredible application of a purely physical idea to Kähler geometry, that really has no business working as well as it does. The concept of *quantization* is of course central in physics, and there are certain contexts in which it makes sense mathematically, but the novelty of Zhang's paper is taking a very hard ""classical"" problem (the existence of a Kähler--Einstein metric on a complex manifold), ""quantizing"" it (turning it into a problem on some Hilbert spaces that algebraic approaches let us solve), and then ""taking the classical limit"" to return to the original problem. Whilst this proof is fundamentally mathematically rigorous, the fact that it works seems to me to be very deep and be intimately related to the nature of quantization in physics.

Hopefully I will be able to impart, to the interested reader, why this paper caught my eye.

#Yau--Tian--Donaldson conjecture

Very briefly, the YTD conjecture asserts that solutions to a very hard global PDE on compact complex manifolds, the [Kähler--Einstein equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%A4hler%E2%80%93Einstein_metric), exist precisely when a certain *purely algebro-geometric* condition is satisfied, called [K-stability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-stability). In principle, this algebraic condition is meant to be ""much easier"" to check than doing some kind of hard analysis to prove existence of the PDE some other way, so the YTD conjecture *takes a hard problem in geometric analysis and converts it to an easier problem in algebra*. In practice it turns out that K-stability is also very hard to check, not because it is equally as hard as solving the PDE, but because it turns out algebra is also very hard!

Just to explain the term ""uniform"" in the title of Zhang's article, K-stability takes the form

""for every (**X**,**L**) associated to a compact complex manifold (X,L), the rational number DF(**X**,**L**) is strictly positive.""

Uniformity here means that instead we say 

""there is an ε &gt; 0 such that DF(**X**,**L**) is bounded away from zero by at least ε""

so uniform K-stability =&gt; K-stability.

#Quantization

In physics, quantization is a process of taking a classical system, and turning into a quantum system. To a geometer, a classical physical system is synonymous with a [symplectic manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symplectic_manifold). Using classical mechanics terminology, the symplectic manifold should be thought of as the space of classical *states* of the system, where each point represents a particular state, and the symplectic form should be thought of as somehow encoding the laws of physics that govern the evolution of those states. Namely if a Hamiltonian is fixed (this is a function on the symplectic manifold that assigns to each state a number, the total energy of that state), then the evolution of that physical system is given by the flow of the Hamiltonian vector field associated to the Hamiltonian using the symplectic form. If you write down what this actually means you get exactly Hamilton's equations of motion.

To a geometer, quantization is a procedure that takes in this data of a symplectic manifold, and produces a Hilbert space of ""quantum states,"" and a rule which takes the ""classical observables"" (smooth functions on the symplectic manifold) to ""quantum observables"" (operators on the Hilbert space) in such a way that the [canonical commutation relations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_commutation_relation) are satisfied for those operators. This process is not fully understood mathematically, except in certain special circumstances. 

One of these circumstances is called [geometric quantization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_quantization), which attempts to define this Hilbert space and the operators on it entirely using the geometry of the symplectic manifold. The ideas behind geometric quantization are generally sound, but it tends to only work well for compact symplectic manifolds (which the phase spaces of actual interest in real world physics are not) along with several other assumptions. 

#Geometric quantization

How does geometric quantization work? Broadly, a ""quantum state"" should be thought of as a distribution of classical states ""smeared out."" One way to make this rigorous is to view a quantum state as some kind of function or distribution on the symplectic manifold of classical states. Physicists like to take L^2 functions because they work well with Fourier transforms and wave-particle duality, so a best guess for the right Hilbert space might be L^2(X, **C**), the space of (**C**-valued) L^2 functions on the symplectic manifold X. This turns out to be wrong in two ways:

1. Locally this is basically right, but globally your Hilbert space of quantum states needs to reflect the non-trivial geometry of your symplectic manifold. It turns out the correct space to consider is instead the space of *L^2 sections of a prequantum line bundle*, which is a line bundle L-&gt; X over your symplectic manifold such that the symplectic form represents its first Chern class (if you like, the line bundle twists in exactly the way the symplectic geometry of X prescribes). Sections of this line bundle look exactly like functions L^2(X,**C**) over small open subsets of X, so this isn't much of an issue.

2. This is the critical issue for my post: **the sections of the prequantum line bundle depend on twice as many variables as they should**. To a physicist, state space is always even dimensional, because it has both *position and momentum coordinates*, but the quantum states should be *either* a function of position or momentum coordinates, but not both. Therefore you need a rule for how to cut down the number of coordinates your functions depend on by half.

#Cutting down the coordinates by half: polarisations

There are several possible ways of cutting down the number of coordinates your quantum states depend on. The most obvious idea is to take a Lagrangian submanifold inside your symplectic manifold (a Lagrangian submanifold is like a ""position slice"" of your symplectic manifold) and then take functions defined on that Lagrangian. This is more or less what a *real polarisation* is. (as an aside for those interested, the cotangent bundle to a Lagrangian should be thought of as the ""position + momentum coordinates"" and it turns out every Lagrangian can be viewed as sitting inside its cotangent bundle with the [tautological symplectic structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tautological_one-form) by a truly remarkable theorem in symplectic geometry, the *Weinstein tubular neighbourhood theorem*).

Another possible method of cutting down the dependencies by half is instead of taking functions f(x1,y1,...,xn,yn), formally replace (x1,y1) by a complex coordinate z1=x1 + i y1, and then make your functions depend on n complex coordinates f(z1,...,zn). To make this rigorous on a manifold you get a *complex structure* which must be compatible with the symplectic structure, in other words you get a [Kähler manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%A4hler_manifold)! For this reason, this trick of is called taking a Kähler polarisation. Precisely, the space of quantum states you take is now the *holomorphic* sections of the prequantum line bundle, rather than the arbitrary smooth (or L^(2)) sections.

It turns out there is a way of passing between these two different perspectives (see [here for some discussion](https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/9912054.pdf)), at least in the case of X=**R**^(2n) = **C**^(n), so physicists view both the ""real polarisation"" or ""Kähler polarisation"" perspective as unitarily equivalent ways of producing the space of quantum states.

Let me summarise the above into a key point:

**Physics predicts that the correct Hilbert space to quantize a symplectic Kähler manifold X is the space of holomorphic sections of a line bundle which is represented by the Kähler form of X.**

#Polarisations in algebraic geometry, and Zhang's paper

Now by what I can only deem to be a fairly incredible coincidence, there is a name for line bundles on complex manifolds which are represented by a Kähler form: **polarisations**. A pair (X,L) of a manifold X and a **C**-line bundle over it which is represented by a Kähler form is called a polarised manifold. 

In algebraic geometry when you have one of these line bundles, which for us is now a prequantum line bundle, the space of holomorphic sections is a well-understood vector space of a lot of importance:

If (X,L) is a polarised manifold, then X embeds inside the projective space P(V^(k)) where V^(k) is the *space of holomorphic sections of kth tensor power of L*. This is essentially the [Kodaira embedding theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kodaira_embedding_theorem) if you are a differential/complex geometer or the definition of an [ample line bundle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ample_line_bundle) if you are an algebraic geometer.

In an old conference proceedings from the 13th international congress on mathematical physics, which is impossible to access online, Simon Donaldson explained how one could view the study of embeddings of a Kähler manifold inside these Hilbert spaces V^(k) as studying the ""quantization"" of the original Kähler manifold itself, which remember should be thought of as a ""classical"" object, since a Kähler manifold is a symplectic manifold. This idea is explained in more detail in Richard Thomas's brilliant [notes on GIT and symplectic reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0512411).

More or less, since V^(k) is just a vector space, one can study inner products on it, and each inner product induces a [Fubini--Study metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fubini%E2%80%93Study_metric) on the projective space. This metric can be restricted to X which is sitting inside P(V^(k)), and serves as a ""quantum approximation"" to the original Kähler metric on X.

#The unreasonable effectiveness of physics in mathematics

The classical limit of this quantum theory occurs as k-&gt;infinity, where Thomas explains that a basis of sections for L^k tend to peak more and more, supported on balls of smaller and smaller radius about the points of X. In this way the quantum vector space of sections of L^k slowly returns back to describing the original space X itself.

**This means that one can study problems on the classical space by solving the corresponding quantized problem on the vector spaces V^(k), and then taking a classical limit back.**

Importantly, the only reason we predict that this mathematically should work in Kähler geometry is because **physics predicts that spaces of holomorphic sections should be the correct Hilbert spaces to quantize a symplectic manifold.** This seems to me to be a remarkable interplay between maths and physics, where physics predicts that a certain scheme should work to solve problems by approximation in Kähler geometry for no reason other than the fact that quantum state spaces should depend on half the variables on a symplectic manifold, and it turns out that this idea is so natural mathematically that it can be applied to a very complicated problem in Kähler geometry and produce a new proof of a major conjecture!

Zhang goes on to exploit this idea by defining functionals on the space V^(k) which approximate a certain key functional on the space of Kähler metrics on X itself, and shows that critical points of those functions approaches a critical point of the functional on X in the classical limit. The details of Zhang's paper are not so important for my post, just the idea executed so effectively.

##TLDR:

Physics predicts that the naive process of quantizing a classical system mathematically depends on twice as many variables as it should, because symplectic manifolds have both position and momentum coordinates, but quantum states should depend on either position or momentum. One way of cutting the number of coordinates in half is to pass to complex coordinates and require your quantum states to be holomorphic. This idea coming out of quantum mechanics is so natural that in complex geometry it can be used to approximate ""classical"" problems about Kähler manifolds by solving ""quantum"" problems about Hilbert spaces of holomorphic sections, and then ""passing to a classical limit,"" a process which we would **only** predict works because the quantum mechanics tells us it should.

This is just one in a long list now of physical principles providing a guide towards how to resolve mathematical problems. String theory and mirror symmetry provide many such examples, and even the very study of ""Einstein manifolds"" and ""Yang--Mills connections"" are examples of how the naturality of objects in physics seems to predict their naturality in mathematics.",math

2397.0,97.0,Major results on differences between finitary and infinitary logics?,oblivion5683,1624049533,"Hello r/math! I self study math and I'm looking to write a sci-fi short that (among other things) explores some basic facts around computation and logic in a world where beings with infinite memory-space, and/or computation-space are an everyday occurance.

to that end, I'm coming to you today to ask some questions in regards to the differences between finitary and infinitary logics!

I'm mainly interested in logics where statements are allowed to be of infinite lengths, rather than ones which are the limits of higher order logics, so primarily first-order infinitary logics, probably with maximum formula lengths which are easily definable within ZFC. These logics would be utilized in a setting where the normal limits of ""we can't store or write down infinite strings of symbols"" is totally moot.

Some questions in interested in:

What do set theories defined in these logics look like? how do particular models (constructible universe, large cardinals, ect) of these set theories differ from those defined in finitary logic?

What do different sizes of infinitary sentence do to completeness, compactness, and the like? (I'm dimly aware that something interesting happens as soon as you hit ω size formulas)

It's not logic per say, but in terms of computability of different sets, how does having access to computing, and storing infinite strings in a single step affect important computational properties like decision problems (Imagine we extend the idea of computable sets of naturals to reals numbers, or sets in general) and the halting problem?

Lastly, how does/could the use of infinitary logics inform the creation of useful theories to explore mathematics? I know that ""True Arithmetic"" would probably be trivial to formulate and use for calculations in some infinitary logics, what kinds of structures we care about might also admit ""true"" theories in infinitary logics?

1) Deep learning of conjugate mappings: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxRazghFL-Y&amp;t=1s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxRazghFL-Y&amp;t=1s)

Here I show how you can leverage deep learning to discover coordinate transforms that can reduce the dimension and simplify Poincare section dynamics.

2) Sparse identification of slow timescale dynamics: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ji2-XUgVl0&amp;t=34s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ji2-XUgVl0&amp;t=34s)

This is a data-driven averaging process that allows one to discover the slow timescale drift of a multiscale signal whose fast dynamics are (approximately) periodic.  

3) Bounding minimum wave speeds: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtjwMMpxLt8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtjwMMpxLt8)

This method relies on using sum-of-squares relaxations of differential inequalities to produce sharp trapping boundaries in dynamical systems. Finding these regions over a range of parameter values can be used to bound the minimum wave speed of monostable reaction-diffusion PDEs from above and below.

I'm currently a rising senior and I want to do a short 4-week research project with an instructor who's working in applied math. Now, I was looking for project ideas that complement how much I know. I can work with ODE's and somewhat with PDE's, though I haven't taken a course for the latter yet, so I'm not sure exactly how much I do know. I have also taken a course for Scientific Computations and basic Mathematical Simulations and stuff, and so I was looking to find a research topic that works with either of these areas, or both of them. I have also worked in python as well. 

Now, I was looking at topics like modelling the spread of Covid-19 in the US before and after the large scale distribution of vaccines, or something related to population dynamics/Lotka-Volterra models. And if not these, then something related to financial mathematics (unless I need more finance knowledge for this, in which case I guess I'll skip out). 

My main question regarding these topics is whether or not they'll make good research topics, and if I'll be able to find a good amount of information to use for these. 

If not, can anyone else suggest anything that would be interesting to work on? I'm going to be taking an applied stochastic processes course along with the research project, so if there's anything i can do related to that as well, I'm completely open to looking into it.

2514.0,14.0,A model for the number of possible moves in chess,holvim,1623877816,"A famous estimate for the total number of possible moves in a chess game is 10\^120, estimated by Shannon, which assumes 30 reasonable moves per position, and if a standard games is 40 moves long (80 plies) this gives 10\^120 possible chess positions (note that a ply is just a half move, which is more convenient since each ply is easier to keep track of than each move which is two plies). I thought I would take this crude estimate a bit further, since we know after the actual number of chess positions up to at least 10 plies (5 moves), 69,352,859,712,417 possible positions. I actually couldn't find anything beyond that, but perhaps I'm not looking hard enough.

If we compare the ratio of the number of possible games after N plies to N-1 plies, we can get a sense for just how fast the total number of moves grows as a function of the number of plies. For example after 2 plies, the ratio of games would be 20 (400/20) times larger than at 1 ply. After 3 plies, it would be 22.25 (8,902/400) times larger than at 2 plies. To get a sense of how fast this ratio grows out to 10 plies I made a plot, where N\_{i}/N\_{i-1} gives the ratio of plies at the Nth move to the previous move.

This ratio grows roughly linearly, meaning that each sequential ply's ratio of positions to the previous one are greater than the ratio at the previous ply. Since the ratio grows linearly, we can attach a linear fit to it (see the red dashed line). From the model, we can estimate the number of possible positions out to N plies (N/2) moves, although the model will be more accurate at smaller N. For example after 10 moves, I predict there are roughly 10\^29 possible positions. After 20 moves, there are roughly 10\^62.

Shannon predicts after 40 moves there should be 10\^120 positions, although my code predicts there are actually 10\^140 which is substantially larger. As an upper bound, my model can handle up to 80 move positions, where 10\^300 possible games are predicted.

This was just a fun little experiment to be a little concrete on just how many games of chess are possible! It's also nice to have something a bit more concrete than other stuff I've seen.

2520.0,20.0,Combining multiple known correlations into one master equation,macsimilian,1623873251,"Hi, I'm doing a research project and have an idea, but I'm not sure how to set it up. It involves determining how a person might react emotionally to situations.

It involves several independent variables: a type of personality, a mood, and the quality of an external reaction. Each of these are defined by various numeric levels. For example, personality could be defined by Extroversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Neuroticism, Openness, each on a scale from 0 to 1. Mood could be defined by two variables: valance and arousal.

Now, say that I knew, or declared, one such correlation that made sense. For example, someone with low valance and high arousal would respond angrily.

My idea is two write these facts as linear equations with lots of variables. Then, solving the equations simultaneously would result in one equation that represents all of the facts.

So the equation for the above would look something like:

mood^valance + mood^arousal = reaction^angry

However, I am not really sure exactly how to write the equations. Does anyone have a better idea on how the equations could be written? Thank you!

edit: should note this will be implemented using computer programming

edit2: I think ""multiple linear regression"" might be relevant/what this is. Still looking for feedback on how exactly to set it up though",math

2522.0,22.0,"SRS-inspired ""nesting"" sequences",ontranumerist,1623867870,"*(If this isn't the right place for this question, could you help me find the right place? Also, I feel like my math-vocab level is too low to most effectively express this, so bear with me.)*

Overall goal: I'd like to find a monotonically increasing ""parent sequence"" that creates ""sub-sequences""  which ""nest"" perfectly into a ""study sequence"" which could be used as an SRS pattern. (Just for fun, not to be used practically.)

Details &amp; Definitions:

SRS (Spaced Repetition System) is a studying system where the interval between reviews increases with each successful review. So the first interval might be 2 days, then 4, 8, etc. (I'm not concerned with unsuccessful reviews here.)

For some item `A`, this ""**parent sequence**"", `f(n) = 2^n` (starting with `n=1`) creates a ""**sub-sequence**"" of `A _ A _ _ _ A _ _ _ _ _ _ _ A ...` (where the `_` are free/non-study days). I want to find a way to ""nest"" such sequences without interference/doubling up because I'm lazy: I only want to study one item per day.

To ""**nest**"" two sequences, create a similar sub-sequence `B` and interleave the two sub-sequences so the first member of sub-sequence `B`  falls into the first gap of sub-sequence `A`.

    A _ A _ _ _ A _ _ _ _ _ _ _ A ...
      B _ B _ _ _ B _ _ _ _ _ _ _ B ...
                                                        
    A B A B _ _ A B _ _ _ _ _ _ A B ...

So two sub-sequences like this can nest, but when trying to add a third similar sub-sequence `C` we get interference:

    A B A B _ _ A B _ _ _ _ _ _ A B ...
            C _ C _ _ _ C _ _ _ _ _ _ _ C
                ^ C/A interference

I'm looking for a sequence `f(n)` that generates gaps in sub-sequences that nest perfectly (or families of such sequences).

A very boring family of solutions is `f(n)=C` for some constant `C`, which generates a simple repeating ""**study sequence**"" (ie: the result of successfully nesting all possible sub-sequences of a parent sequence) of `C` items such as `A B C A B C A B C A B C ...` for `c=3`.

Sure, this works, but I'm after a non-constant parent sequence so that the resulting nested sequence contains an infinite number of sub-sequences (I have a lot of flashcards to study).

I found an interesting family of `f(n)`, but I don't remember how (I wrote the code to generate it two years ago), and I don't think I can translate the code into a simple equation. The first few items in the sequence are

    1, 3, 1, 11, 1, 3, 1, 43, 1, 3, 1, 11, 1, 3, 1, 171, 1, 3, 1, 11, 1, 3, 1, 43, 1, 3, 1, 11, 1, 3, 1, 683, 1, 3, 1, 11, 1, 3, 1, 43, 1, 3, 1, 11, 1, 3, 1, 171, 1, 3, 1, 11, 1, 3, 1,43, 1, 3, 1, 11, 1, 3, 1, 2731, ... 

Which seems to be [sequence A276391](https://oeis.org/A276391) in the OEIS. It generates a ""study sequence"" of

    AABBAABBCCDDCCDDAABBAABBCCDDCCDDEEFFEEFFGGHHGGHHEEFFEEFFGGHHGGHHAABBAABBCCDDCCDDAABBAABBCCDDCCDDEEFFEEFFGGHHGGHHEEFFEEFFGGHHGGHHIIJJIIJJKKLLKKLLIIJJIIJJKKLLKKLLMMNNMMNNOOPPOOPPMMNNMMNNOOPPOOPPIIJJIIJJKKLLKKLLIIJJIIJJKKLLKKLLMMNNMMNNOOPPOOPPMMNNMMNNOOPPOOPPAABBAABBCCDDCCDDAABBAABBCCDDCCDDEEFFEEFFGGHHGGHHEEFFEEFFGGHHGGHHAABBAABBCCDDCCDDAABBAABBCCDDCCDDEEFFEEFFGGHHGGHHEEFFEEFFGGHHGGHHIIJJIIJJKKLLKKLLIIJJIIJJKKLLKKLLMMNNMMNNOOPPOOPPMMNNMMNNOOPPOOPPIIJJIIJJKKLLKKLLIIJJIIJJKKLLKKLLMMNNMMNNOOPPOOPPMMNNMMNNOOPPOOPPQQRRQQRRSSTTSSTTQQRRQQRRSSTTSSTTUUVVUUVVWWXXWWXXUUVVUUVVWWXXWWXXQQRRQQRRSSTTSSTTQQRRQQRRSSTTSSTTUUVVUUVVWWXXWWXXUUVVUUVVWWXXWWXXYYZZYYZZ...

I said that I found a whole family of such sequences. The next one in the family seems to be [sequence A120437](https://oeis.org/A120437) in the OEIS

    1, 1, 7, 1, 1, 7, 1, 1, 61, 1, 1, 7, 1, 1, 7, 1, 1, 61, 1, 1, 7, 1, 1, 7, 1, 1, 547, 1, 1, 7, 1, 1, 7, 1, 1, 61, 1, 1, 7, 1, 1, 7, 1, 1, 61, 1, 1, 7, 1, 1, 7, 1, 1, 547, 1, 1, 7, 1, 1, 7, 1, 1, 61, 1, 1, 7, 1, 1, 7, 1, 1, 61, 1, 1, 7, 1, 1, 7, 1, 1, ...

And then a sequence I couldn't find in the OEIS:

    1, 1, 1, 13, 1, 1, 1, 13, 1, 1, 1, 13, 1, 1, 1, 205, 1, 1, 1, 13, 1, 1, 1, 13, 1, 1, 1, 13, 1, 1, 1, 205, 1, 1, 1, 13, 1, 1, 1, 13, 1, 1, 1, 13, 1, 1, 1, 205, 1, 1, 1, 13, 1, 1, 1,13, 1, 1, 1, 13, 1, 1, 1, 3277, ...

These are interesting solutions, but they aren't applicable to SRS, because they aren't monotonically increasing.

I believe it's impossible to find a monotonically increasing parent sequence that nests perfectly, but I don't know how to prove it (and I'd love to be proven wrong).

So I suppose I'm asking for help finding existing literature around this type of problem. I'm having a hard time following the stuff at the OEIS entries I linked, so I'm not sure if those areas are in the right direction for this.",math

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Now it was well known experimentally that $\\phi(x)$ could be quite different from an analytic function, for instance it could have no derivative at some points...

&amp;#x200B;

where \[; u(x,t=0) = \\phi(x) ;\] is the initial profile of a one dimensional string in the wave equation.

My question is then, what were these (or any) known initial conditions with non-differentiable points?

My trouble understanding this is that any example I can come up with seems like the non-differentiable point was introduced as a simplification to a differentiable function with a possibly large second derivative. For example, ""plucking the string"" could be modeled via a piecewise linear function.

\[; \\phi(x) = ;\] 

\[;\\begin{cases} x &amp; 0 \\le x \\le 1/2\\\\ 1-x &amp; 1/2 \\le x \\le 1 \\end{cases} ;\]

On the other hand, the initial condition could be modeled as the length minimizing curve pinned at \[; x=0 ;\] and \[; x=1;\] which must be above some shape (e.g. a sphere representing the contact point of a finger or pick).

All modelling requires some amount of simplification, but if the initial condition contradicted the understanding of the mathematics of the time, what forced the hand of mathematicians to accept these initial conditions with non-differentiable points rather than stating that a different, more realistic initial condition was needed?",math

2594.0,94.0,What is the normal development of a mathematics course? What constitutes good teaching?,disembodied-tenure,1623779192,"I was wondering what is the standard way in which a mathematics course develops. By approach and development I mean the educational dynamics and quality. I've never had any kind of contact with higher education before, so I did not know what to expect. 
The things I describe could very well be proper of my particular university, which I would not expect you to hear about in a lifetime. Moreover, I'm from a third world country that follows national standardisation of higher education. My point is, maybe things are handled different around here.
Several of my courses involved awfully poorly written textbooks, with seemingly poorly written proofs. The development of the subject  appears awkward, and  shows poor writing skills, it's almost as if it was written with informal and innacurate secular language. 
The worst part is, the class is based on this textbook. The professor limits herself to read this aloud, literally. At moments it's hard to follow, and altogether fails to illustrate the big picture. I've heard most of mathematics consists of not understanding and feeling stupid, but I have the feeling the presentation here lacks structure. Aside from pointing out how this obliterates any beauty, I cannot stress how annoying that is.
You know about the pleasing experience of reading an author and being taken around the subject by his mastery (and delightful writing)? To be witness of his ability being effortlessly able to tackle the subject from any viewpoint, even if you abruptly shifted the perspective, stripping it from any pillar that doesn't rely on true understanding. I thought that is what an university professor would be about. 
Notice it's not my wish to be spoonfed with the contents, I take responsibility for my part, I don't expect for a professor to make of learning a painless process. Moreover, since my classes are not in person, I give them the benefit of the doubt.

You might be thinking, why don't I read the bibliography? As soon as I noticed this, this is what I aimed for, but unsurprisingly, it's extremely time consuming. It altogether serves as a substitute professor, it supplies not only supplemental material but the whole thing, and if that is going to be it, then I could very well be learning on my own. 

Also, what kind of practice is usually assigned? I usually had weekly one page worksheets whose resolution was nowhere to be found.  I obviously took practice from outside sources, but this seemed a bit off.

Is this all common practice among mathematics courses? I have a long history of being unsatisfied and critical with teachers (altough never from higher education level), so I was wondering if my concerns are unreasonable.",math

We are Phoenix Space, an NGO delivering STEM education to refugees throughout the Middle East and online. To raise awareness of our mission, we’ve launched a space-themed academic competition for our students, but also for **students around the world**: The Launchpad Challenge. There is a sponsored cash prize (3000USD) and promotion for the winners, who will have the opportunity to refine and defend their submission in front of a virtual panel of experts. We think this would be a wonderful opportunity for students to enter, and we look forward to seeing a diverse array of submissions from all over the world.

**Details of competition:**  
Students aged 15-19 will develop and present a creative, idea-based solution to a problem faced in the development of a Martian base and society. Working in teams of up to three, entrants will identify and define a problem statement from one of three topic areas related to human habitation of Mars and develop a logic-driven, researched solution to the chosen problem. Submissions don’t need to be hard-scientific, and we have prepared a lot of guidance for entrants: where to start researching, how to find a mentor, and a framework for also three examples of initial submissions.   


The final judging panel will be chaired by Professor Ugur Guven, and will involve experts from a wide range of disciplines. 

To learn more about the competition the prizes and the work we do, visit

Now I am definitely not a mathematician, I study compsci and know a decent amount of undergrad math but not enough to form an independent opinion without consulting more knowledgeable people.

My question is what mathematical entities remain valid (consistent) with finitism? By extension, which math fields remain consistent and which fields are outright rejected by finitists? For example, since a finitist rejects the concept of an infinite set, how could the idea of a function be defined? (as far as I know, a function is defined as a potentially infinite set of (x, f(x)) pairs).

  
Moving on, since it can be constructively shown that the number sqrt(2) can exist, how can a finitst reject that because it has an infinite symbol expansion? By rejecting it wouldn't they also need to find a flaw in the construction of the number.

My question in a sense is ""which parts of modern mathematics remain consistent with finitism and which do not?"" and by extension do finitists provide alternatives to the fields they reject?

I notice exponents appear everywhere, frequently. Squares. Cubes. Even greater powers. Everywhere!

The way I picture exponents is as expressing a very definite type of bezier-type curve progression; a progression that is exponential (hence the curve) rather than linear. Fine.

But what I don't get is why do so many things, expressed by formulas, equations  and such, have to obey these very specific curves? Why not a slightly different curve?

I'll give an example to illustrate this a bit better. I know of the inverse square law which is common in many physical descriptions. For instance I believe luminosity is expressed as proportional to the  inverse square of the distance from its source. Why does it have to be so... square... Why not expressed a slightly non-square curve that doesn't perfectly follow this squaring progression? It's not just luminosity. So many non-geometric things seem to behave this way. Like tracking virus transmission. So many things!

Or am I just thinking this all wrong? I just intuitively 'graph' exponents in my mind as these specific curves or humps, and the larger the exponent the quicker that hump starts to approach a peak, but unlike fractions, these curves don't take ""in-between"" values. Arrrgghhhh.

I guess what I mean by ""in-between"" is we get doubling, trippling, quadrupling, but why not one-third-aling, or three-quaratling or two-and-one-half-aling? Y'know?

Forgive me if I'm not expressing this very well. Something just strikes me as unintuitive about exponents when expressed as curves. Geometry is fine with me. Any help pointing me the right way will help dislodge this fuzzing way of thinking so I would appreciate it very much!",math

The length of the arc is one third of the circumference of the circle, therefore the probability that a random chord is longer than a side of the inscribed triangle is **1/3**.

&gt; 2. The ""random radial point"" method: Choose a radius of the circle, choose a point on the radius and construct the chord through this point and perpendicular to the radius. To calculate the probability in question imagine the triangle rotated so a side is perpendicular to the radius. The chord is longer than a side of the triangle if the chosen point is nearer the center of the circle than the point where the side of the triangle intersects the radius. The side of the triangle bisects the radius, therefore the probability a random chord is longer than a side of the inscribed triangle is **1/2**.

&gt; 3. 
Random chords, selection method 3
The ""random midpoint"" method: Choose a point anywhere within the circle and construct a chord with the chosen point as its midpoint. The chord is longer than a side of the inscribed triangle if the chosen point falls within a concentric circle of radius 1/2 the radius of the larger circle. The area of the smaller circle is one fourth the area of the larger circle, therefore the probability a random chord is longer than a side of the inscribed triangle is **1/4**.

&gt;These three selection methods differ as to the weight they give to chords which are diameters. This issue can be avoided by ""regularizing"" the problem so as to exclude diameters, without affecting the resulting probabilities.

So how do these three apparently valid solutions coexist? 

&gt;&gt;!The problem's classical solution (presented, for example, in Bertrand's own work) hinges on the method by which a chord is chosen ""at random"". The argument is that if the method of random selection is specified, the problem will have a well-defined solution (determined by the principle of indifference). The three solutions presented by Bertrand correspond to different selection methods, and in the absence of further information there is no reason to prefer one over another; accordingly, the problem as stated has no unique solution.!&lt;

We define a path-covering of X as a set P of continuous paths \[0,1\]⟶X with the following properties:(i) all paths are non-constant(ii) the images of two paths do not intersect(iii) every x∈X lies in the image of some path.

\[0,1\]\^d has a path covering. So does S\^1. But what about S\^2or D\^2? I think they don't. I also think (0,1)(0,1) SHOULD not have a path covering but it does - you can keep adding tiny paths to fill out everything. Maybe we can add a new axiom to fix this?Furthermore:We say that two path coverings PP and Q of X are equivalent if there exists a homeomorphism f:X⟶X so that f becomes a bijection of paths from P to Q, up to reparametrization.The obvious questions are: How many non-equivalent path coverings does a topological space contain? Does \[0,1\]×R have two? Vertical stripes and horizontal stripes?

2668.0,68.0,Transversality and Differential Equations,simpleawareness,1623699188,"I am studying manifolds and slowly coming around to the fact that transversality is a big deal.  At first I thought it was a silly technical condition to make submanifolds intersect properly to set up a cohomology theory with an intersection product, but it seems that computing intersection numbers is really a tool to compute things that we care about. 

I am still quite hazy on the details, however, and was wondering if anybody should shed any insight on the problem.  Specifically, I would like to know how transversality conditions plays into the calculus of variations (which obviously connects up with dynamics and physics and many other things.)

Does the transversality condition have something to do with boundary conditions?  Does it tell us something about existence or uniqueness of solutions?

I was reading Hirsch’s book on differential topology and it mentioned a quote which said something to the effect that “the secret of manifolds is transversality,” and I want to believe this is true since so much of geometry (moduli theory, algebraic geometry, etc) deals with intersection theory and needs a good notion of transversality to set up the theory.

But I am having a hard time pinning down the basic intuitions, and I am thinking something from variational calculus or dynamical systems will point me in the right direction for further study.

Does anybody working in these areas have any insight into this?",math

2716.0,16.0,Question on intertemporal choice,extremeaxe5,1623626688,"Von Neumann Morgenstern (VNM) utility theory asserts each VNM rational
agent has a utility function u: S -&gt; R, where S is the set of ""states of
the world"". There are no restrictions on the function u. The VNM utility
theorem states that a VNM rational agent behaves as though they are
maximizing the expectation of u.

I am trying to generalize this beyond a single time step with a ""total
utility function"" U: S^N -&gt; R (see
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discount_function). Such a U would dictate
a rational agent's choice in the more realistic model of the world where
there are a sequence of states. Again, the agent would behave as if maximizing the expectation of U.

Unfortunately, I'm not sure how to define this U. I cannot find
references on this subject. Specifically,

- **What coherence axioms should this U satisfy (for a ""rational""
  agent)?** For instance, perhaps ""consistency over time"", meaning for
  s1, s2 sequences of states where s1[0] = s2[0], then U(s1) &gt; U(s2) iff
  U(s1[1:]) &gt; U(s2[1:]).
- Speaking of the above, **what is a ""rational agent over time""?** The
  [Wikipedia
  article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_discounting) on
  hyperbolic discounting describes it as a ""time inconsistent"" model of
  delay discounting. How do you formalize this?

All sources I've looked at seem to assume U can be defined by a ""single
state utility function"" u: S -&gt; R and a ""weights sequence"" w: N -&gt; R,
and that for a state sequence s, U(s) = u(s_i) dot w_i. **Is there a more
general theory of such U**?",math

I'm reading that the problem is conditional on the host knowing where the car is when he reveals the door, but not elaborating any further. I thought ""him knowing where the car is"" was just a substitute for ""he won't reveal the car breaking the game"", but after doing some reading I'm getting the impression that there some probability stuff I'm not understanding.   


So my question is, let's say the host does not know where the car is when he reveals a door, but will only reveal a door that is not the one you choose (eg. You choose A, he randomly reveal B or C). After you choose a door, if the door he reveals is the car, the game restarts from the beginning and you get to play again. If the door he reveals is a goat (which he didn't know but eventually happens because it's the only way the game continues), is it not still smarter to switch at this point, like the original problem? Or is there something going on that I don't understand, that's making this a true 50/50.

When you multiply a number by 9 and it’s below 10, you take (the number you are multiplying by 9 then minus 1 from it). That’s the digit in the tenths. Then you do (10-the digit you are multiplying into 9). That’s the singles digit.
For instance 9x7= 6 in the tenths and 3 in the singles. =63

For instance 9x420 you get 4190.
Take 420 again and subtract 10. You will get 410 as the second number. Then you subtract the second number from the first number.

2797.0,97.0,Prime numbers in three dimensions - is this is a thing?,VStarffin,1623511516,"As I was falling asleep last night, my brain decided to think about that prime numbers can be thought of geometrically. Specifically, a prime number can be defined as any number that *cannot* be the area of a rectangle with integer sides greater than 1. So a prime number can be mapped on to the geometric concept of area. Conversely, composite numbers are the set of numbers that *can* be the areas of rectangles with integer sides greater than 1.

Now, this idea obviously *can* be extended to three dimensions. You could define a 3D prime number as any number that cannot be the volume of a brick with integer edges greater than 1. Similarly you can define a 3D composite number as the set of number that *can* be the areas of bricks with integer edges greater than 1. And I presume you could extend this into any dimension. And as the dimensions go up, the number of primes increases relative to the number of composites (I think). 

So the question isn't necessarily whether this makes (since I think it does), but rather is this...in any way interesting? Is this just another way to conceptualize something that's already very obvious? Is there a term for this?

It is #3 on his key points [https://trialsitenews.com/should-you-get-vaccinated/](https://trialsitenews.com/should-you-get-vaccinated/)

The link leads to his paper, where he has cited a study done in the New England Journal of Medicine ( [https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2104983](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2104983)) and altered some of the findings.

The results of the study in the New England Journal were "" Among 3958 participants enrolled in the v-safe pregnancy registry, 827 had a completed pregnancy, of which 115 (13.9%) resulted in a pregnancy loss and 712 (86.1%) resulted in a live birth (mostly among participants with vaccination in the third trimester). Adverse neonatal outcomes included preterm birth (in 9.4%) and small size for gestational age (in 3.2%); no neonatal deaths were reported. ""

Now he has taken that quote and claims "" the authors report a rate of spontaneous abortions &lt;20 weeks (SA) of 12.5% (104 abortions/827 completed pregnancies). However, this rate should be based on the number of women who were at risk of an SA due to vaccine receipt and should exclude the 700 women who were vaccinated in their third-trimester (104/127 = 82%)""

2830.0,30.0,-40 is where Fahrenheit and Celcius Are Calculated As The Same,Rahuldeb5,1623456945,"Hey guys, I found an interesting number in temperatures that might surprise you. You might already know about this, but it really impressed me.

So I know the formula for Fahrenheit to Celcius is (F - 32) \* 5/9 = C

And the formula for Celcius to Fahrenheit is (C \* 9/5) + 32 = F

So taking all this in, I knew before that Fahrenheit is going to be greater than Celcius like 32 F to 0 C, but that is not always true. 

I remembered a time when I read an article about temperatures going up to -70 Fahrenheit and when I converted that to Celcius the Celcius would be a greater number.

So I started wondering when does Fahrenheit stops being greater than Celcius and starts becoming less value. 

So I did a bunch of equations with trial and errors and I finally came to the number (-40)

\-40 is a curious number because if you try to convert -40 from Celcius to Fahrenheit or vice versa it's the same.

While ""A Mathematician's Apology"" appears to attempt to express the joys of mathematics to a wider audience, the true message of this essay is incredibly sad. Under the guise of a passionate memoire, ""A Mathematician's Apology"" hides the desperate defense of a man's life work.

Hardy wrote this essay towards the end of his life; the twilight of his career. Many accounts note that as his most productive years began to wane, a depression began to set in for Hardy- who even attempted to take his own life as a result. 

A common theme is the debate on useless versus worthwhile endeavors, and Hardy stoutly defends his field as one of the most noble of human pursuits. 

To this day, ""A Mathematician's Apology"" remains one of the most influential essays on Pure Mathematics, for good reason- because what Hardy conveys is one of the most accurate accounts of the pursuit of higher knowledge.",math
2832.0,32.0,Undergrad feeling inadequate for summer research project,Tupples-,1623450959,"Hey r/math, I am looking for advice with my current situation. I'm not sure if this post fits the guidelines, so mods feel free to remove it if it doesn't.

I am currently an undergrad in a math major who will be entering my final year this fall. This summer, I had the chance to earn a government-issued scholarship to pursue a research project with one of my professors. We are working with another student (from another university). The first three weeks went okay, I did some preliminary readings in the project subject out of an undergrad-level introductory textbook, meeting my professor once a week to discuss what I'd read and clarify any questions I had.

However since then I've really struggled with what I'm asked to do. First, we have switched to a different textbook (graduate level material this time) and are reading one or two sections a week. I'm expected to present one section every week, but I'm really struggling to grasp the ideas in it. I feel like I'm stumbling over small details that should be trivial, not getting the big picture at all and generally only understanding maybe 60% of what I'm reading. This seems to be compounding each week as the material I should be going through rests on previous topics that I haven't mastered yet. My presentations basically consist in copying down what was written down in the textbook; I'm not able to give insights and don't feel like I'm achieving much with them.

Next, I'm expected to work full time so around 35 hours a week, but I'm finding it extremely difficult to stay focused 7 hours a day reading dense math texts and struggling to understand.

Finally, we have started working on the research question itself, and it seems my professor and the other student are working much quicker than I am able to; I basically can't really follow what they are talking about each week.

All of this has been causing me a great deal of stress, anxiety and feelings of inadequacy. I feel guilty of not being able to offer any new ideas, contrarily to the other student we are working with. I also feel quite guilty because I'm on a scholarship and the professor is the one who approached me to work with him. He told me he approached me because of my grade in his class (A+; I have a 4.30 GPA).

I'm wondering if any others here have experienced feelings like this during undergrad. Do you have any tips for me? Should I talk about this with my professor? Should I just double down on my efforts and work harder? Is it normal that I find this extremely difficult even though I think I'm a pretty good student in a classroom setting?

tldr; Feeling out of my depth on the research project I'm working on with one of my professors, what should I do to feel less anxious about it?

Thanks in advance!",math

For example, I am an applied math major in my sophomore year. I took Calculus 3 and Linear Algebra this semester and think I got a decent understanding of the concepts in the latter (Lin Alg), not so much in the former (Calc). However, it's only been a few weeks, but I feel like I have forgotten some things from Lin Alg - I expect this to only exacerbate over the coming more weeks. 

On the other hand, with Calculus 3, I didn't feel like I understood several topics well throughout the semester (even though I scored decently).

My questions:

1) Is taking a course for 4 months really sufficient to ingrain that knowledge? If not, how do math majors and even mathematicians remember the 'basics' (calc 3, lin alg) while their research is focused on other things?

2) How does one 'ingrain' this type of knowledge? For me, proficiency in Calculus 2 came from practice for a year in high school + teaching it to others. Is it really feasible to focus on each math course this way to 'ingrain' that knowledge?

So I probably have no idea what I'm saying but I came across something interesting and that's what I want to present.

So I was reading introductory material to group theory, and I came across a statement in the book,

""It is mathematically impossible for crystals to have a D_n symmetry pattern with n = 5 or n &gt; 6""

As soon as I read this, something immediately clicked.

In the 2020 INMO, Problem 5 was quote
""Infinitely many equidistant parallel lines are drawn in the plane. A positive integer n ≥ 3 is called *frameable* if it is possible to draw a regular polygon with n sides all whose vertices lie on these lines and no line contains more than one vertex of the polygon"".

With some working, one can conclude that the only frameable numbers are 3,4, and 6. (n is not frameable for n = 5 or n &gt; 6)

I really couldn't help but feel these two results are connected to each other one way or the other, and I'm really not sure how. (I'm not even sure if they're connected for that matter, but given that this is math, I want to believe). Perhaps one of you could educate me.

Atleast in US colleges math starts out with two rounds of Calculus and then a round of Linear Algebra. Students fear proof writing and solving difficult problems in general. Many just hate Calculus because of the way it is taught.

Why is it so? Can't the curriculum be revamped and structured in a way that it teaches us how to think? Rather than chugging data into formulas.

As a young man, I spent the free time of over a week in the university library studying this book. I did not make it far, working through primes and Farey series without having a firm grasp on either, before abandoning the endeavor at lattice points. Their ability to conjure formulas from seemingly thin air made me seriously question my ability to ever become a mathematician; finding the reason why just one of their tricks worked took me hours, and they would often employ two or three mathematical devices establishing a single lemma. I couldn't see how I would ever be able to do such things on my own.

But, you see, these men were smart. Seriously smart. Exceedingly likely, they were more intelligent than either you or I could dream of being. They were so smart that they knew this would be the case, for me and so many others like me, studying the work of past masters, so that we may one day emulate them. They planted a seed. They knew. They knew what it's like to need to know; when it's not a choice what your mind turns to at the breakfast table, in the car, in the shower, or in bed at night. They understood that they would be doing harm to the future of our mathematical enterprise if they spoon-fed us the truths we crave. Math moves on, and they, and others like them, won't always be around to hold our hands, tell us what to look at, and what to see. This drive to grasp at, and touch, the unseen and the unknown, lies at the heart of every research mathematician. They weren't teaching us to think like them. They're teaching us to think, and ascend to our place among the countless other human minds who have ever and will ever be, so we may have our own very individual dialogue with the universe of numbers; and every honest, unguarded conversation with the living body of mathematics brings with it a new experience and new perspectives of it, enriching us all.

I encourage you, wherever you are in your talk with math, to continually engage with material that stretches you in a serious way. Actively seek to spend a lot of time not knowing the answer. If you find yourself solving many problems without encountering major obstacles, search out or enlist help in finding some math that leaves you clueless. We're better for it, even if we end up never finding out the answer. Fact of the matter is, most questions will be left unanswered at the end of the show, and there is a certain natural ordering in this fact. We don't give up in the face of the intrinsically unknowable. We give structure to that which we can, and find that even the unknowable has structure to it, giving information about what it can and can't be.

The idea led to a generalization of a lot of my previous work, and led to straightforward proofs of a lot of the previous results. Not only that, but with the new theory the proofs were beautifully illuminating - everything followed from an elegant approximation argument which made it clear why the more technical and difficult proofs before actually worked. It was math heaven.

Then, I proved a result which was still known to be true, but for which the proof was just a *little* too easy. The estimate used seemed way too crude to yield such a strong result. So I got a little suspicious - I started to go back and check if I had made an error somewhere. Sure enough, I looked back at the first lemma I’d written, on which the entire theory rested, and found a subtle flaw in the argument. Even worse, the problem was unfixable; there was no way to recover the argument without that crucial step. The entire theory collapsed, and with it went all my elegant proofs.

So the classic proof wants to find a contradiction, and goes like ""assume sqrt(2) is rational, so that would mean sqrt(2)=a/b where a and b are integers with no common divisors. Then you get a\^2=2b\^2, so a\^2 would be even"". Now the step that just started to bug me, years after I first learned the proof: a\^2 being even implies a is even. Shouldn't there be more explanation at this step? The proof wants to then show that b is also even. But what if neither a nor b are even? Since we initially assumed sqrt(2) to be rational to go about all this, couldn't we take c=sqrt(2)\*b (where c is hypothetically rational because sqrt(2) is hypothetically rational), where c isn't even but is divisible by sqrt(2) and that would still give us c\^2=2b\^2=a\^2. The contradiction should be in showing that sqrt(2)\*b cannot yield an integer c.

It's as though in the middle of the proof we assume sqrt(2) to be irrational, therefore the only way for a\^2=2b\^2 to make sense is if a is even.

its as if it was trying to get to a specific decimal, with more decimal spots each time  
its similar as when you try to multiply a two numbers with decimals to get a whole number for example 10.0502512 times 3.98 (which makes 40 (not exactly but its close enough)), in this case 10.0502512 is the specific decimal and I got it by just multiplying 10 times 3.98, then 11, but I want 40 exactly, so I start adding decimals places and stuff  
I don't know why it does that and I've done some research and it doesn't seem like that has been found before, keep in mind those numbers have no relation whatsoever between them except that they are the amount of twin primes in sets of 1 to 10^(n), because if you set the list like it should be:

2  
8  
72  
715  
7145  
  71429  
714287

you can notice how its just basically multiplicating by 10 and is being subtracted a few numbers, in the list it shows (starting from 8) Nx10-8, Nx10-5, Nx10-5, Nx10-21, Nx10-3, now I don't really see a pattern between the changing subtrahends, im not sure what all of this could mean but if this hasn't been noticed yet I just want to point out that it seems like there could be a constant that makes the rate of twin primes decrease exponentially, and btw heres the code (the language is [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) (if youre gonna download it, then download the one that says ""current version""), its not that popular but somewhat)

    Loop, 100 ;try different things like 100 or 1000
    {
    	plus2 := A_Index+2
    	var := IsPrime(A_Index)
    	var2 := IsPrime(plus2)
    	if (var = 1 &amp;&amp; var2 = 1)
    		var1++
    }
    var1--
    MsgBox, %var1%
    return
    
    IsPrime(x) {
    	Return x == 2 || x == 3 || x == 5 || x == 7 || (Mod(x, 2) &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; Mod(x, 3) &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; Mod(x, 5) &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; Mod(x, 7) &gt; 0)
    }

once you download autohotkey, right click on your desktop and go to new, then to New AutoHotkey Script, right click, click edit, it will open notepad by default (btw it only works on windows) and just insert the code, ctrl+s or save, and then double click on the file on your desktop, then try changing the 100 at the top for something like 1000 or 10000, but first go with 10 and make your way up, I recommend no more than 1 million bc it takes some time to check if every number is prime and which of those are pairs of twin primes",math

Many of you have heard me peddling my interactive video software here before. If not, check out https://ractive-player.org/math/ and https://ractive-player.org/blog/2021/06/01/desmos-react.

This weekend, I'll be livestreaming showing how to get started making these and troubleshooting/answering questions.There will be two sessions, both starting at 12pm Eastern on the [Discord](https://discord.gg/u8Qab99zHx).

Saturday is aimed more specifically at math teachers, so it will cover the basics of web development and show how to use a lot of the math features. Sunday will be for general use and will assume more familiarity with React; math people should go to both. A recording will be posted for those who can't make it.

He does math left to right style rather than the normal way, making it easier

24+32 would be 20+30 which equals 50

Then, 50+4 =54

54+ 2= 56 as final answer 

or 

546+325

1) 500+ 300= 800

2) ( remember 800) 40+ 20= 60

3) 800+ 60= 860

4) 860+ 6= 866

5) 866+ 5= 871 final answer

**basically, you are adding 100's with 100's, 10's with 10's, 1's with 1's, so 538 would be 500+30+8**

The usual method would have you carrying and each number would of been though of individually ( in the ones place), and not in the proper place it was in ( the 5 in 653 being though as simply a 5 and not 50)

&amp;#x200B;

Subtraction was the same, left to right method 

38-11

1) 30-10 = 20

2) 20+8=28

3) 28-1= 27 as final answer

One result was that quadric surfaces can be thought of as the set of self-orthogonal vectors under an appropriate definition of inner product over a field and that vector space is a projective geometry.

I apologize if my definitions are muddled or unclear -- it has been decades since I studied advances math.  I was hoping to find a resource about the subject of projective space as a vector space and how different inner product definitions affect the geometry of the vector space.

2979.0,79.0,controlling cubes visually,ianofshields,1623321021,"I hope this is a good place to post these thoughts. They are more related to visual arts but I am looking for some deeper understanding of the nature of a cube in order to better represent them in computer graphics. I need to make a chessboard which led me to consider the idea of a cube itself in 3d.

I have decided that cubes are only visually cubes in blender because of the limitations of visual technology used to display them. They are actually notionaly and topologically spheres! The spherical nature of what we call ""the cube"" in 3d can be evidenced by the 3 spoked poles at the corners of each face. I have decided that cannot be correct!

A real cube would have a minimum of 4 spoked poles at its corners. I believe a better way to consider a real cube is to think of it as a cylindrical prism with a rotational symmetry of order 4 and 3 planes of volumetric symmetry when viewed from above. That is, it has a top, a bottom and a side described by four faces.. We need to force the cube/sphere to be a cylinder but without the many spoked poles or n-gon caps which are usual in a cylinder. The real problem lies with the subdivision surface modifiers. They cannot interpret the necessary idea of an infinitely spoked pole cap the way a real cube requires.

You may have  previously noticed that an icosphere has identically shaped faces all with the same amount of edges coming from their poles. This is a mathematically consistent method of approximating a sphere. but the subdivision modifiers do not work well with triangles so that is even further away from something we could make into a cube. I imagine that this is historically why the icosphere exists in 3d packages as it will ultimately give you the best approximation of a sphere mathematically. but the amount of subdivision required is so high that it is virtually useless in the reality of 3d modelling.

A UV sphere seems to be much closer to a cube than the cube we are used to!! This is because it can be thought of as having a top, a bottom and a faceted side. It is simply a cylinder forced to take the shape of a sphere.

A cubic sphere is only mathematically a sphere when it has 6 sides. After that it just becomes a reshaped sphere and will always retain the perfectly spherical features of its six sided resolution at its poles which resolve to pinching over which we have very little control beyond reducing the size of that influence.
	
I can force this cube/sphere to more closely represent a cube but while the corners have 3 spoked poles it will still be a shaped sphere and the reflection of light around those corners will be perfectly spherical in nature. This spherical singularity can be minimised and there are ways to disguise this fact through closely situated geometry or heavy meshes but it will always be there and it will always generate influence over the rendering of the object.

A cube should not be thought of as a six sided object. It should be considered to have a planar top, a planar bottom and a cross section described by four planar faces. The interpretation of these three elements should be thought of only in relation to its observation when rotated in space. For example:

When you see a dice on a table, you would perhaps say that you rolled a “6” because that is what is on the top. if i asked you “where is the 4?”, you would say it is on the side. we dont really have good methods for describing the orientation of the sides in spoken language because notionaly we think of the other numbers as being just on “The Side”. knowing the nature of the arrangement of numbers on a dice you would also say that the “1” is on the bottom. I think this intuition can be leveraged when considering the topology of a cube in 3D.

To describe a cube in 3d (suitable for use with the catmul-clarke algorithm for subdividing geometry) is actually a much trickier prospect and, because of catmul-clarke, a partially spherical nature cannot be eliminated but it can be negated (have its influence reduce to 0). That is; we can redefine the boundaries to be cubic in nature and hide the 3 spoked poles on the flat surfaces which make the sides pushed back by a minimum (and perhaps a maximum based on the probablity of deformation?) of 2 boundary loops.

This problem is amplified by my necessity to have the equally sized squares of a chessboard kept in their proper positions within the cube.

I have been trying to come up with a decent method to create this thing and the solution i have so far offers good control over all areas of curvature while forcing renderers to calculate the flow of light over corners in a much better way. but I still have those 3 spoked poles and although their influence can be reduced to 0 I wonder if there is a better way to think about the mathematical nature of a cube?",math

For example, would we say (2+1)st, ""two plus first,"" or would it be (2+1)th, ""two plus one-th."" (The astute among you might prefer the avant-garde term ""third"").

We defined the exponential map, which takes a left-invariant vector field and spits out the integral curve of this vector field starting at the identity element, evaluated at 1. So if we call this curve gamma, gamma(0) is the identity of the group and gamma(1) is the output of the exponential map. We are told that, if one chooses a representation of the Lie algebra, a linear map rho from the Lie algebra to the endomorphisms of some vector space V, and we use the usual exponential map on these representatives of the Lie algebra elements, we will get a different set of invertible endomorphisms on the same vector space V that constitutes a representation of the Lie group. So, in plain terms, that if we represent the Lie algebra elements and swap the fancy exponential map for the usual one, we will get the same elements of the Lie group, only in the form of a representation.

My question is why does subtracting the values you get from plugging in the point (3,2) into the function that describes any line (y = mx+b) with the function itself, give you the equation for the entire line?

Suppose A is a subset of B as well as of C, such that the intersection of B and C isn't null. Could we say that  B could prove A to be consistent, and C could prove A to be inconsistent?

Does this mean that the consistency of A is indeterminate until we specify a superset to be used to be used to prove its consistency? Does the consistency truth value function C(A,B) have two parameters, set A and its superset B?",math

The first goal of the course is to develop the necessary theory to become comfortable using spectral sequences in topology and possibly also in algebra. If I decide to continue making videos, there will be three more goals: (1) understand algebraic K-theory, (2) learn about chromatic homotopy theory, and (3) understand factorization homology and the Ayala-Francis proof of the cobordism hypothesis. 

The course assumes knowledge of topology at the level, say, of Munkres and abstract algebra (groups, rings, modules, fields, etc.). I'll be introducing category theory and eventually infinity-category theory as well.

There can't be a finite number of finite natural numbers, because the set of all finite natural numbers does not have a finite upper bound, i.e there is no largest finite number. You can always add a new finite natural number, meaning the set is infinite

But there can't be an infinite number of finite natural numbers because (assuming 0 is excluded from the set of natural numbers) if you have a set of n natural numbers the highest number in that set will have the value n. If n in the set of all finite natural numbers is infinite, then that implies there are values in the set that are infinite, which is a contradiction.

This implies the existence of a ""largest finite number"", which obviously doesn't exist

After a homogeneous 1st order ODE for which I pulled out a solution of *y = x* (???), I came to the last question of the paper, worth 20%, and I fell the fuck apart. First, I couldn't figure out what form the particular integral needed to be in for this 2nd order ODE, which is one thing. Then I had to do a linear 1st order ODE. I made the given solution fall out, and it asked me to ""explain"" why it went to zero as x went to infinity, and I didn't know what the fuck they wanted from me, so I just did l'Hôpital's rule until I got the limit.

This is where the disgrace comes in. It then asked me to find the global maximum and minimum of the function *for x ≥ 0*. An interval closed on one end, and I didn't think to check what the value of the function there was. So I was going into this thinking the derivative would give me two critical points, but it didn't: it gave me one, because I ended up with a quadratic in √x and it had only one positive solution (the golden ratio, as it happened). What did I do? I INVENTED A SECOND ROOT. I declared that for x real, √x would give me a negative number, and I plugged those into my function, saw which one was bigger, and labelled them the max and min accordingly. No consideration as to what the function actually looked like. No consideration for the fact they *told* us to ""explain"" why it tended to zero (rather than ""show""), which would have let me know that I could declare the max a max without resorting to the second derivative (my saving grace is that I didn't go on fucking Desmos and plot it, like one of my coursemates did).

I don't know what came over me. I'm actually scared by it. If it were discrete maths (the module I fear) or real analysis (a true battle of wits and nerve), I'd understand metaphorically running around like a headless chicken, but it was bloody calculus for fuck's sake!

Essentially, as we learn more, more information becomes a prerequisite. Thus as young people try to get into the field, they have a lot more content to catch up on. Eventually this has to hit a point where the amount information one would need to learn would be insurmountable right?

I've been progressively growing my YouTube channel over the past 18 months and my content has been rather well-received by my students and many members of these math subreddits. I do my best to be consistent with content, but since I animate my videos (using the program developed by 3Blue1Brown), it takes me quite some time and effort to produce this content. 

I'm constantly thinking about how I can add to the general mathematics community, and so I'm contemplating running live-streams where people can join me for some amount of time to talk about mathematics. This is something that I'm not seeing done by math YouTubers (apologies if you're a math YouTuber doing livestreams!) I do not want to use the livestreams to solve problems, but rather discuss the intuitions I've gained from thinking about certain concepts, share my experience, and maybe even offer advice on things that have improved my ability and experience with mathematics. 

Of course, granted such lines of thinking, the first question that comes to mind is: Does anyone want this, would anyone find this useful? If so, please reply to this post so I can gauge interest. Also, if you have other ideas on gaps in the existing mathematical community that would be valuable, please share that too.

My question is. What happens if I flip the hypothetical coin an infinite amount of times?

I can't really wrap my head around it as it is possible that it would be heads an infinite amount of times (right?). So by that logic if could also be tails an infinite amount of times?

The solution I found was that you should split the winnings (where player 1 needs to win r more games, and player 2 needs to win s more games) as:  
sum from k=0 to r-1 of (r+k-1)C(k)  
to  
sum from k=0 to s-1 of (s+k-1)C(k)

the idea being that if player 1 wins and player 2 gets k against them, you play r+k games and there are (r+k-1)C(k) ways of arranging the non-winning games before the winning one that goes to player 1; and similarly for player 2.

However, every solution I've found online assumes that the players will always play r+s-1 more rounds, even if one would've ended up winning before then.  This results in different calculated splitting proportions so the solution that results from this assumption is clearly not equivalent to mine.  

I can appreciate covering the approach of Pascal for historical reasons and don't begrudge Pascal for making that assumption while he was literally inventing the tools as he went, but it seems unreasonable to call it the ""solution"" to the problem when it doesn't seem to represent how the game would truly go.

Is there some other reason why one would want to consider the players playing all r+s-1 games even if one would win before that which I failed to notice?  Alternatively, have I made an error somewhere that would cause my solution to fail to be equivalent when it should be?",math

I'm 17M and my dad is a middle aged man. I love math, but I wouldn't consider myself well versed, as the most advanced math I've taken is calculus. My dad was like that when he was my age, but as he fell out of practice, his abilities naturally declined, but he is still very smart. However, we've had an on and off argument about a math topic recently, and I just can't get over how he doesn't understand my logic.

Basically, the premise of the argument is probability and how to calculate it. My dad's initial point of view was that the chance of any event happening is 50% because there are two possible outcomes (the event happens or it doesn't) and one desired outcome (the event), therefore 1/2.

Now, obviously, this is insane. I was baffled when the conversation that initiated this whole thing led to that, so I was stunned in silence for a moment, before I tried to prove that it was not so.

I presented a classic ""thought experiment"" about probability: the colored balls in an opaque bag, and what the result would be if you were to randomly select one. In my example, the bag contained 4 red marbles and 1 blue marble. So, logic would dictate that the probability of randomly selecting a red marble would be 4/5, and blue would be 1/5, even though there is one desired event and two possible outcomes.

This did not convince him for reasons I can't remember, but I tried another example, this time one which would have no real world physical way of calculating the probability of the events (or at least, by a layperson). If I were to reach into my left pants pocket and found something in there, what are the chances that it's a million dollars and I'm now a millionaire? Obviously, working purely mathematically, I know the probability is 0 because I know I don't have a million dollars in my pocket. However, I like to think that in the real world there is always a non-zero chance of something happening (idk, heard about quantum tunneling about 4 years ago and never looked into it more). So realistically, I have absolutely no idea what that probability would be, but my dad says it's 1/2 because, you guessed it, it either happens or it doesn't. Practically, we can deduce that the probability is likely less than 1/2 through experimentation, as in repeatedly reaching into my pocket and trying to produce a million dollars. I told him this, and he kind of froze for a second before saying something along the lines of ""well, now that you have the knowledge from experimentation, you can deduce the probability is likely less, but until you have that knowledge the probability is 1/2"".

I just. What. Did he seriously just first say that the chance of everything is 50% and now he is implying that probability of an event happening changes based on knowledge? I didn't know how to respond.

Eventually, I decided to go back to the marble example. I told him that hypothetically, a bag with 4 red marbles and 1 blue marble appears somewhere in the universe. With the given conditions that exactly one randomly selected marble will float out of the bag, that precisely 10 seconds after this happens both the bag and all the marbles inside or out of it will disappear, and that no being in the universe has knowledge or will ever have knowledge of this happening, what is the probability of that floating marble being red? This  is the most perfect example of randomness that also satisfies my dad's conditions of knowledge that I could think of. The theoretical probability is clearly 4/5, correct?

He answers with 1/2.

I'm baffled for a third time now. He wasn't getting it. The reason why I like math is that it has black and white answers as opposed to the grey areas that humanities subjects have, and every mathematical term has a precise definition. He just wasn't getting that precise definition. By this point I fear that I will become irrationally angry if I continue this conversation with him, so we ended it with a polite ""agree to disagree for now"" situation. The problem is, this is not a topic of opinion. There is one truth, one objective truth. And generally, my dad is very intelligent with objective manners, so I've come to three possible conclusions for why he still does not agree with me, which are:

1. That he knows he is wrong and is unwilling to admit it (This is probably the most likely of the three, he has a history of this, especially during political and ethical debate, but those are less objective topics)

2. That he's fucking with me (Very unlikely, he sounded very genuine and he normally does not do those things)

3. That he fundamentally misunderstands probability and how it cannot be impacted by knowledge of events (Seems like the middle ground of likelihood)

Whichever one of these conclusions are true, or perhaps maybe a fourth I didn't think of is, I do want him to understand this concept and tell me that he does with ernest. He's very smart and I can't handle him not understanding this objective truth (also part of me really wants to be right in this situation, I know, immature, but it is what it is).

Here is a new gradient formula for working out the gradient of any given graph f(x)

**THE INVERSE GRADIENT FORMULA**

The graph f(x) at point (x,f(x)) and red line showing gradient using the inverse gradient formula

This function can be used to solve for gradient of any graph at any given point.

**x is the point at which you want to find the gradient**

**i stands for infinity (you could use numbers like 100 - it still works!)**

**f(x) is the function where you substitute in your function**

Overall, I believe it is very accurate at functions such as tan(x), f(x), x\^2, x\^3-2x etc.

3286.0,86.0,Books that teach you both the how and why of a topic,dsengupta16,1622993135,"There are mainly 3 types of books on any mathematical topic. 

1. that is purely mechanical (computational) - e.g. Stewart's Calculus used in almost all US freshman classes
2. super abstract, doesn't contain any numerical example or calculations - e.g. can't think of any particular right now
3. the most interesting type that mixes both the how and why - e.g. **Vector Calculus, Linear Algebra and Differential Forms: A Unified Approach** by **Hubbard and Hubbard**

The reason I like 3rd type the most is that they motivate the topic very nicely and then goes into rigorous analysis by proving the same topic. This is more natural for someone learning the subject for the first time. Even mathematicians who came up with the idea for the first time were probably working on it using some geometrical diagram or some small numerical example. This is an important strategy used in competition math i.e. create a miniature version of the problem assuming some numerical values and try to arrive at the solution. A book on algorithms that uses this type of teaching is **Introduction to Algorithms** by **Udi Manber.** It heavily uses mathematical induction and talks about the exact design of the algorithm.

Type 2 books are good for already experienced people trying to brush up a concept. The 3rd type is hugely beneficial for 1st timers. Type 1 is for people who will not dive seriously into math later and are taking the course only to satisfy some requirement.

I know there may be many people who like Type 2 more than Type 3. But, to me, Type 3 is the most beneficial when I study an entire unknown topic for the first time.

Can you mention some books of Type 3 on any topic of maths that you have studied and liked very much?",math
3287.0,87.0,The logic gate adventure,soyuzonions,1622992056,"# Context

It all started 2 months ago when i wanted to create tic tac toe in APL. APL is very basic, and is mostly just pure math, so when i had a hard time even making an IF statement, i gave up. Now, 2 months later, i got the idea to use logic gates to not only play tic tac toe in APL, but also create a fully functional tic tac toe AI using only math.

# The idea

The idea was to create a formula, where when i put in the current positions in a tic tac toe board, it would output the next optimal play. I would do this by kinda simulating logic gates in math. For example, in an AND gate, if input 1 and input 2 are both on, it would output; on. Like this:

AND gate = a\*b

if a = 1 and b = 0, a\*b = 0. As you can see, a\*b is only 1 if both are 1. Here are the other gates (mostly made up of NAND gates):

    AND         = a*b
    NAND        = 1-ab
    OR          = a+(1-a)b
    NOR         = 1-a-(1-a)b
    XOR (oh no) = 1-(1-((1-ab)a))(1-((1-ab)b))

# The full adder

At this point i wanted to test my sytem by making a full adder (tic tac toe took too much effort). But heres where i stumble onto a couple of limitations. First of all, if i want two outputs i have to make two formulas. Anyways, this is what i did:

    inputs: a, b, c  --  outputs: S, C
    
    S = XOR(XOR(a, b), c) = 1-(1-((1-(1-(1-((1-ab)a))(1-((1-ab)b)))c)(1-(1-((1-ab)a))(1-((1-ab)b)))))(1-((1-(1-(1-((1-ab)a))(1-((1-ab)b)))c)c))
    
    C = OR(AND(XOR(a, b), c), AND(a, b)) = ab+(1-ab)((1-(1-((1-ab)a))(1-((1-ab)b)))c)

Another problem, wolframalpha doesnt understand this. Even if i put all variables to 0, S just wont compute, it gives me the ""Wolfram|Alpha doesn't understand your query"" error. But thankfully C is more compact, and it works flawlessly! Also, im in the first year of high school and i have no idea what im doing, the most experience i have is making adders in Minecraft.

# What?

Trying to understand what im doing is hard, and it feels like ive gone down some wierd road of existentialism. I think im making a calculator to calculate binary math, inside an equation. An equation that solves equations, but what if i translate this to binary and solve it in the equation? Why am i doing this?

What am i even doing?

I tried talking to my boyfriend about this, but he lost me at logic gates. This is the point where i came up with the idea to post it to r/math to see what you guys think. Sorry for bad spelling or for rambling by the way, english is my second language so it doesnt spellcheck.

Both are analytic, mutatis mutandis both can't have maximums in the interior, for both Liouville's theorem applies.

In dimension 2, every harmonic function is the real part of some holomorphic function, and every holomorphic function has harmonic real and imaginary parts. So there's almost a correspondence between the two.

In several variables something similar might be true but there's some issues of dimension.

So, is the study of harmonic and holomorphic functions equivalent?

If not how do they differ?

3321.0,21.0,Adding a function normal to another function.,Kitsyfluff,1622942742,"Background for how I reached this problem.

I'm writing a parametric airfoil designer in desmos in my free time, and I've made the standard NACA airfoils to start with. But now I'm trying to implement the Riblett method, which is produced via adding the distribution curve (let's call it D(x) normal to the camber curve (C(x) ). 

The standard NACA method is a simple D(x) +C(x)=U(x) (upper surface) and D(x) -C(x) = L(x) (lower surface)

I'm currently exploring it all in Desmos. This man's airfoil design has had me burning with questions that I just don't have answers for, because he died without ever sharing how he actually produced his airfoil designs, and his book mentions that he added the distribution normal to the camber line and ""misc other improvements"" that complete lack of  specifying what he did drives me nuts, so I've been trying to figure it out bit by bit.

I've gotten as far as having the normal to a point N on the camber line and a circle of radius D(N) at that same point, meaning I now have two intersection points that trace out exactly the shape I'm going for.

On Desmos I've used the simple x\^2+y\^2=0 notation draw the circle of radius D(x) by using 

r(x) = sqrt(D(x)\^2-x-N) + C(N), and algebraically making a more useful function out of it.

and the normal: Rn(x)  = (-1/C'(N)) \* (x-N)+ C(N)

(there's two formulas for forward and aft of the max camber point, but that's not important for this )

It seems like something that should be simple, but I'm not sure what to read up on. 

However my main question is, I feel that I'm going about this in a roundabout way, and wondering if there's possibly a method that purely simply adds function 1 normal to function 2.

3334.0,34.0,A pretty cool (but completely useless) function I found,42IsHoly,1622925086,"So we all know you can write numbers in different bases, but something interesting is that you can sometimes write a number in its own base (kinda), for example: 1.1_1.1 = 1*1.1 + 1*(1.1)^(-1) = 221/110

So why not do something similar, but for π? What is 3.14159..._π? Sadly enough this doesn’t work, since the digit 4 wouldn’t exist, but if we just ignore that we get this infinite series:
S = 3 +1/π +4/π^2 + 1/π^3 + 5/π^4 + 9/π^5 + ...
First we need to prove that this series converges, which is surprisingly easy: 
take the geometric series: z = 9+9/π +9/π^2 + ...
Every term in this series is larger than or equal to the corresponding term in S, so z &gt; S and since z is a geometric series we can see it converges to about 13.202
If you actually calculate it, it’s 3.8413...

But there is no reason to limit ourselves to pi, we can define a *pseudo-base function, which we’ll call B.
B(x) = Sum (x^n * nth digit of x)
Where the ones digit is the 0th, the tens digit is the 1st, the 1/10s digit the -1st
the hundreds digit the 2nd, etc.
This function converges for all real numbers greater than 1, which we can prove with same argument to show that B(π) converges. We can also easily see that B(1)=1 and that B(0) is undefined. This leaves ]0,1[ (I’m ignoring negative inputs). And here is where B becomes quite surprising, because it sometimes converges and sometimes doesn’t. For example:
B(1/2) = 10
B(1/3) diverges
Now I’d suggest you try and find when B converges yourself. Trust me it’s worth it.

For x is in ]0,1[, B(x) converges if x has a terminating decimal expansion! Now if that doesn’t amaze you, I don’t know what will. Here’s the proof:

Since x&lt;1, x^(-huge number) will be very big and an infinite series can only converge if it’s terms go to 0.
So all terminating decimals converge (they’re essentially finite sums)
If a decimal is non-terminating that means we have an infinite series where the terms approach infinity, so clearly the function will not converge.

tl;dr B(x) is a function that converges for all positive real numbers except non-terminating decimals between 0 and 1",math

I was bored the other day and I was experimenting with some equations. This is what I got: **4a=(+;second last digit=a/3;last digit=2a/3)**.   I am sharing it here with you guys/girls, since you are knowledgeable  on the topic. Is this something new (I googled it. I did not find  anything like this)? Is it interesting?

**4a=(+;second last digit=a/3;last digit=2a/3)**, for example a=9 then, a\*4= 36

9/3= First digit=3; Second digit=9\*2/3=6; Two digits are 3(first digit) and 6(second digit) that form number 36.

So, 4a=(first digit=a/3;second digit=2a/3); 36=36

\----

Other equation is:**7a=(+;second last digit=2a/3;last digit=a/3)**, for example a=12, a\*7=84

24/3= First digit=8; Second digit=12/3=4; Two digits are 8(first digit) and 4(second digit) that form number 84

So, 7a=(first digit=2a/3;second digit=a/3); 84=84

\----

In  the upper examples third of a number is integer (it is easier to show  formula with examples). The formulas are true for every single number.

For example a=5

so, 4a=(first digit=a/3;second digit=2a/3)

Left side:4\*5=20

Right side: First digit: 5/3=1,666666… ; Second digit 10/3=3,333333…

And so, I thought math had to be a religion because what math asserted to be true ultimately depended on whether one believed the axioms from which math was derived from. Like a religion in this sense, I thought there was ""faith"" or this idea of accepting truth when truth is unknown through axioms, and thus through this necessity of faith, mathematics was essentially a religion (to me, religion is intrinsically some form of faith and ultimately, an assertion of truth).

But after further debate and pondering it more in my own mind, I've come to realize that this way of thinking does not reflect on the nature of mathematics. Mathematics itself does not assert axioms to be true or false, rather it is an illustration (a painting if you will) of the consequences of assuming axioms to be true. That is, mathematics is not concerned with whether something is true, but rather what are the consequences if something (like an axiom) is true. Mathematics can be viewed as a theory of hypotheticals in this sense. As math does not assert truth, but simply plays around with it, there is no faith required, thus making mathematics not a religion, rather a tinkerer of belief.

For someone like me who has delved into different mathematical fields decently in depth in my own time (primarily algebraic fields of math), I find it amazing how this simple change of perspective has remained so elusive to me, but crucially important to my understanding of mathematics. Frankly, I'm almost ashamed to call myself a mathematician of any sorts lacking such a foundational perspective. I think this phenomenon is not exclusive to me however. 

Far too often, people (I once among them) misconstrue math as fact or giving some sort of truth, or inner beauty of the world (not surprised, after all we say proofs are ""true"" all the time). That is not the job of mathematics; it is the job of science that asserts some form of truth through math and thus rigidity by which beauty can be born in the world. Math is removed from the world, and so its beauty (at least in my opinion) comes not from what it says about the world specifically but how different facts are connected in unintuitive, yet rigorous ways to produce awe.

Sorry if this post seems long, tangential, and sloppy at best, but I wrote this at 4 AM because I was truly enthralled with these ideas. Please let me know what you think. I think further discussion can help me formulate deeper connections and ideas about math I have so long remained blind to. 

Also, I have one remaining question that I have not yet resolved: What does it mean to believe math then if math isn't a religion and how did we come up with something so removed from the world like math in the first place?",math

Throughout my most recent semester I have dealt with stochastic PDEs and have found them interesting simply as a nice overlap between PDEs and stochastics, my two main interests.

1. Establishing the fundamental theory (making everything formal, generalizing finite dimensional stochastic analysis, work-horse theorems)
2. Existence and or uniqueness of strong/weak/mild solutions to a some class of SPDEs.

This is all very nice but whenever I see a result of the 1st type I think: ""Huh, neat, so this works in infinite dimensions too"" and whenever I see a result of the 2nd type I think ""Huh, neat, so this works with randomness too"".

You might see where I am getting at: Where are the fascinating theorems that could motivate me to go deep into the d

3411.0,11.0,Generating new prime numbers from the product of them (not by subtracting or adding 1),Guilherme17712,1622823151,"So, first, let's start by some fundamental stuff.

Let **X** be **36**, for example. We know its factors, right? **36 = 1\*2\*3\*6.**

Now let's suppose another number **Y = 27**. We also known its factors, since **Y = 1\*3\*7**.

Ignoring 1 as a factor, we can predict at least one guaranteed factor present in **X-Y** and **X+Y**. We can just see a factor that is present both in **X** and **Y**. In this case, **3**, so we know **X+Y** and **X-Y** are numbers divisible by **3** (you can test it if you want).

Knowing that, all the other factors that don't repeat from **X** to **Y**, will definitely not be preset in **X+Y** nor in **X-Y**.

Applying that for prime numbers, think about it with me for a second. First, let's just map out a list of prime numbers, here:

**2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13**

We can play around with primes (fundamental factors of all other numbers), in such a way that uses the **X** ± **Y** factor defining solution to our advantage.

Let's start multiplying all of the primes from the list, as we slowly separate some groups, I prefer starting them from the bigger number, to the smaller.

**2\*3\*5\*7\*11\*13**

can become:

**6\*35\*143**

which can be transformed into:

**6\*5005**

Now, I want you to think about that with me again. We have 5005, a number formed by all prime numbers, from 5 to 13. And we have 6, a number formed by all prime numbers from 2 to 3.

We can predict **5005** ± **6** is a prime number, since there is literally no shared factors.

In this case, **5005 - 6 = 4999**, which is indeed a prime number.

**5005 + 6 = 5011**, which again, as predicted, is a prime number.

And that happened to all list of primes that I tested with (making sure, of course, you have a list big enough, like **\[2, 3, 5\]**.",math

I am an aspiring student interested in doing research in extremal combinatorics, (hyper)graph theory, additive number theory (as in Tao and Vu's book), and theoretical computer science.

I took ""Classical Algebraic Geometry (AG)"" in my third year, and we covered things up to like projective varieties, coherent sheaves, divisors, and so on... I understand that for someone working on (extremal) combinatorics, one does not necessarily need that “fancy machinery” to solve problems; even if one needs it, usually it's sufficient to use polynomial methods and other (linear) algebraic methods. I know that some theorems in the field were proven with things like real varieties, flag algebra, and so on...

So, I think my central question is, would I be ""wasting"" my time on brushing up my knowledge of AG from, e.g., Gathmann's and Fulton's notes (if I eventually in (extremal/arithmetic) combinatorics)? What do you think of the future of applying AG to discrete side of mathematics? I am aware that a lot of tools from AG seem to work in algebraic/multiplicative number theory, but not additive part of the story?

I hear that really small things only resolve to a known state when observed by a person.

State of being, and the *higher* beings ability to manifest our universe's state of being. 

We have 3 quantifiable factors of the 4 needed for this ratio:  Our awareness of a really small thing, the really small thing, and the universe.

From the outside, it resembles a group of people talking to each other. The theme of the discussion loosely depends on what was said before and no one really knows how it all started.

You can join in if you want but you will need to speak some dialect first. An implicit algorithm is used such that the people can agree on the validity of what is being said.

Some people have started to translate the discussion from the original set of evolving natural dialects into programming languages. In this new setting, the implicit algorithm can be made explicit and the translation checked mechanically. If no mistake is found in the algorithm or in the translation, we can be confident that what was said is indeed valid.

Given such explicit algorithm, we could in theory build an other algorithm enumerating and storing all the valid sayable things. It would produce an ever growing database but its content would be extremely redundant. You would need to compress this stream of data to make it less regular and more interesting.

This is in fact what the people talking implicitly have in mind. They enumerate a compressed, never-ending representation of verifiable discourse and sometimes share the compressed data streamed thus far with their peers replicating both storage and validation in the process.",math

3455.0,55.0,[UPDATE] I created a proof assistant!,pirsquaresoareyou,1622781841,"A little more than a month ago, I posted about a proof assistant I have been working on named CORE (I still don't know what it stands for though). I would like to share a few exciting updates about the language.

The language has evolved, and it now has a more convenient syntax. Most of my work, however, has been seeing what I can prove with it. I made a [website](https://been-jamming.github.io/CORE/) where you can see all of the proofs, axioms, and definitions I've made in CORE. If you click on any result, you can see the CORE source code used for the result. Inside of each proof, the bold words are links to previous results that are used inside of the proof, so you can recurse through results you are not familiar similar to how one can recurse through links in wikipedia articles. Here are some of my favorite results:

1. [02\_relations: equivalence\_classes](https://been-jamming.github.io/CORE/02_relations/equivalence_classes.html)  
How to define equivalence classes was perhaps the first tricky problem I ran into. It's not exactly clear what a good definition would be like, but I settled with:  
`define is_equivalence_class(R, A, C): ^X(X in A &amp; *Y(Y in C &lt;-&gt; Y in A &amp; are_related(X, Y, R)));`  
which means that an equivalence class `C` is a set of elements which are all related to one fixed element. I was quite pleased with how conveniently the fact that equivalence classes exist and are disjoint followed from this definition. 75% of the battle in these results seems to be coming up with the best definitions.
2. [NATURALS\_induction](https://been-jamming.github.io/CORE/03_addition/NATURALS_induction.html)  
Induction on the natural numbers follows directly from my definition of the natural numbers, which almost feels like cheating!

Don't worry guys, 2 + 2 really is 4! I've checked myself.
4. [naturals\_recursion\_theorem](https://been-jamming.github.io/CORE/03_addition/naturals_recursion_theorem.html)  
This was very tricky. There are lots of sequences which are recursively defined. Take for example, the Fibonacci numbers. For any value of n, we can calculate the nth Fibonacci number, but how should we define what a Fibonacci number is? We can say that either it's 0 if it's the 0th Fibonacci number, 1 if the 1st Fibonacci number, and that it follows the recursive rule. However, this definition references itself which makes it logically an invalid definition! For example, I can say that a number n is ""jello"" if n - 1 is ""jello,"" but this can't be a definition of a ""jello"" number because it references itself. This theorem allows us the construct sequences like the Fibonacci sequence which follow a recursive rule.  
Also the typical definition of addition is recursive, but I somehow found a way of constructing addition before I had this theorem!
5. [TWO\_times\_TWO\_is\_FOUR](https://been-jamming.github.io/CORE/04_multiplication/TWO_times_TWO_is_FOUR.html)  
This is recent. I finally defined multiplication! Once I derive the simple properties of these operations and transfer them over to the integers, I'll be ready to see if I can formalize some elementary number theory.

Also, I want to mention that this is just for fun! I'm aware that nothing I've proven is original, I'm just having fun with it.",math

All in-plane motion is modeled normally, but inclination doesn't exist, or you can just pretend it's always exactly 0.  My first stab at the problem involves just using the equations meant for 3d, and always having the z component of my vectors be 0.  This works of course, but I feel like I'm wasting complexity and compute time for no reason.

Here's the first set of equations, used to convert a state vector into orbital elements: https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/1904/how-to-programmatically-calculate-orbital-elements-using-position-velocity-vecto

The very first step poses a problem - the angular momentum vector in this case will have 0 magnitude in x and y, but the Z magnitude is actually quite important.  I suppose it would be possible to calculate the magnitude in the Z direction (which in this case is equal to the magnitude of the entire vector) and store it as a different value, but I'm kind of talking out of my ass at this point.

The node vector should be undefined, but that can be solved by just using an arbitrary direction (positive x in my case) to serve the same purpose.

I've been reading this book for a personal project. While the actual project requires some info in a middle chapter, I've decided that I do enough computational geometry that I should probably read through the book sequentially.

I don't think I've read a single page where I haven't stumbled across something that's made me go, ""whoa, that's cool!"" Stuff like: ""here's a natural and meaningful formula with just four determinants which tells you whether three lines defined by six points coincide at a single point. We can use this to prove Pappos's theorem in a jiffy.""

The writing is immaculate, with enough rigor to explore calculations, but lucid and motivated at every step. I only get occasionally confused, which is usually dissipated with a few minutes on pencil and paper. There are very few prerequisites to entry, only high school geometry and linear algebra, although some of the conversations may require the mathematical maturity of an intermediate undergrad math student (talking about groups of projective transformations, although he walks through the definition at a leisurely pace, sometimes mentions fields or topology, but again in an elementary context). It's never tedious, despite a large amount of calculations, because he motivates each one and infuses excitement.

Richter-Gerbert clearly has a spark for this topic, and it shines through in this book. If you're ever in the need for a primer on Projective Geometry or the calculations of geometry in computer science, I could not recommend this book enough.

I recall doing “proofs,” which I haven’t done in about fifteen years. I’m trying to reflect back on the proofs I once did to better understand what was meant by that word. What do mathematicians (and perhaps logicians, if they both have the same conceptual framework) mean when they say they’ve provided a proof of something? Is there a relationship between proof and possibility and if so what is it?
In everyday communication, if someone says “I’ve proved that X must be the reason why A happened,” it gives off the impression that neither Y nor Z nor any other possibility could account for A. There seems to be a “closing off” of all other possibilities when someone says they’ve proven something. (In some ways, prosecutors give off this impression when they try to “prove” to a jury that the defendant is guilty.) Is something similar implied when mathematicians say they’ve provided a proof of something? Does it entail a sort of “closing off” of all other possibilities?
A concrete example in the reply might help. For example, “When a mathematician says that they’ve ‘proven’ that ‘1+1=2,’ what they mean is this: ... “
At least in philosophical discourse, some have said that Whitehead and Russell “proved” that “1+1=2” in Principia Mathematica. What do we mean when we say that someone “proved” that “1+1=2”?",math

3533.0,33.0,Is Benfords Law a function of time decay?,Issherai,1622698214,"Hey /r/math! 

I'm not sure if this is the right place for this, but I'm hoping to get some clarity on the topic (or perhaps get pointed the right direction if I'm doing this wrong??). 

I recently learned about Benfords Law and am wondering if I'm misunderstanding this concept correctly. 

It seems to me that if you measure any finite set of naturally occurring numbers in any system with decay or entropy, you're bound to have the probability of a number occurring decay as the number increases. 

For example, take a finite number (the schools in my city) and measure them by how close they are to my home. Because the number is finite, and we're measuring a limited distance, it's mathematically more probable that there are 11 schools within my city than 99. So as numbers increase (1-9) the probability of them occurring goes down. 

This would also mean that if you extrapolate Benfords Law to be measuring not just 1-9, but 1-99 or 1-999 it will still apply and 999 has a statistically miniscule but still measurable lower likelihood of occurring than 998.

Am I understanding this correctly? 

However, in any INFINITE system or unnatural set of numbers, the factor of a limit (decay) will no longer apply, and Benfords Law will also no longer apply. 

I really hope I'm right in this. My brain is melting and my girlfriend is convinced I'm crazy.",math

*Processing img qlhlxewspy271...*

However, since this application is meant to be in real time, I am searching for some suggestions on how to determine when a 'stable' value is reached. In the picture, the overshoot is caused by setting an initial value of 0. I'm calculating the rpm by first using the change in angle over the change in time to calculate the radians per second, then converting it to rpm.

&amp;#x200B;

 I plotted it with an axis reference at the median value of the response (24.9275). Can someone please advise me on how I can determine when the calculation converges to a relatively stable value? 

I have this thought that it can be done using some type of error calculation between the current and previous point. But I don't know if this is possible because of 1) such a high sampling rate which I do not want to change, and 2) because it has a underdamped harmonic response.

For instance, there should be away to determine that the previous X AMOUNT of values have a very low difference between one another and therefore the value of their average is a stable value?

Also, the RPM is not known at the time of measurement. Thank you!

With a typical sweepstake you draw a team and if they win or come second you win a prize. The main issue I have with this is that for those that draw the lowest ranked teams they lose interest quickly as their chances to win are very slim. 

I was searching for a alternative method to organise the sweepstake and found this article on [maths.org](https://maths.org): 

[https://plus.maths.org/content/football-sweepstakes-how-make-them-fairer-and-more-fun](https://plus.maths.org/content/football-sweepstakes-how-make-them-fairer-and-more-fun)

I think this is an interesting route to take so I spent some time looking at how the scoring system panned out over the past five Euro tournaments (2016, 2012, 2008, 2004 and 2000). 

I've put it in to a spreadsheet here:

If you change the points scored by each shirt number in row 4 of the front sheet that allows you to tweak the scoring system. 

Keen to get a view on if this can be made more 'fair' based on historic scores, especially the more recent years where shirt 7 seems to have become really quite powerful and shirt has died in a ditch. Or should I just stick with the prescribed scoring system",math

After going back to limits in calculus it seems odd that when you are approaching zero as your divisor in a function it seems to approach infinity until it goes to the negative side of the cartesian plane, but still we don't say that dividing by zero is infinity, because some rules in Math will be broken and we could make 1 = 2.

I haven't done any research into it or I have no idea how to search or start searching on such question if it was already asked before, but what if we actually defined infinities into some sort of symbol similar to how we defined complex numbers as ***i***

Like whenever we divide any number by zero it would be a form of infinity multiplied by the number just by adding a symbol for infinity, for example if it was ***q,*** if we do 10 ÷ 0 it would be 10***q*** so that we could remove the special case for zero when any number is divided by itself would equate to one. I don't want to replace the infinity symbol, I'm just giving an example so that I can write expressions without getting awkward about the infinity symbol.

we could expect the following simple equations:

n ÷ 0 = n***q***  where ***n*** is a number and ***q*** is the symbol for infinity  
n***q*** \* 0 = n  
0 ÷ 0 = 1 as the result of 0 ÷ 0 would be 0***q*** or 0\*1***q*** which would simplify to 1 but would result into infinity multiplied by zero is equal to one.  
1 ÷ 0 = 1***q***  
2 ÷ 0 = 2***q*** and so on...  
***q*** ÷ 0 = ***q***^(2) since we cannot quantify infinity into a square of a number.

The situation in the US seems to be that, and that is only my own impression, unless you have advanced programming skills in at least 2 different languages, already did a couple of projects on your own, did some internships, networked like crazy, basically majored in applied mathematics with tons of statistics, probability theory, numerical mathematics and machine learning under your belt and optimally didn't even think about attending courses in pure mathematics, not a single company is going to take you seriously and the only job that you're able to land is that of a high school teacher, but only, and I mean only, if you're ready to move at least 500 miles away.

The theorem: all integers greater than 1 are both the median and mean of two prime numbers. 

Derived from Goldbach’s conjecture (all even number is greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers) and from the idea of consecutive integers.

2k = prime + prime, where k = any integer &gt; 1 

So (prime + prime)/2 = k

The two primes will also create a boundary (my term, have no idea whether it’s appropriate): one of the prime represents the first term in a series of consecutive numbers where the second prime represents the last term.

With consecutive numbers, the average of the series is (1st + last)/2

Thus (prime + prime)/2 = k means that k is the average of these two primes.

And we’re talking about consecutive numbers, the average of these numbers also represents the median.

Prior to this, I have studied algorithms, linear algebra, calculus and discrete mathematics under guidance, meaning a course in university. Due to reasons, my passion to mathematics can only be extended in this way--self study--for now. One of the reasons that I have the balls to self-study because I got A in all the above courses. 

After some researches, I learnt about Steven Abbott's Understanding Analysis. The self-studying has ups and downs. Till now, I roughly realize a methodology to approach a problem. This methodology is not great, but it usually offers a starting point after which I can expand upon. 

1. Proof by contradiction
2. Apply theorems established in previous chapters or sessions

As I enter chapter 4 continuity, the shortcomings have been obvious--they fail to offer a starting point. For example, in a question I was asked to prove

* If a continuous function is defined on an interval, then the set of points which failed to be one-to-one will either be empty or uncountable.

Both methods get me no where. It was not until I did some Google and Math Stackexchange where I realized I should instead start by 2 cases, the function is constant or not.

It goes without saying there won't be a theorem or method stated explicitly in the textbook documenting this approach.

I am both frustrated and relieved after learning the solution. On one hand, my imposter syndrome kinda relaxed since I have never learnt this method before. Can't blame myself if I don't even know that thing exists. On the other hand, if the theorems I have learnt cannot offer a good starting point, then how can I even begin to solve the problem? Studying theorems again and again won't get me that ""a-ha"" moment anyway since the expected method wasn't even documented in the first place..

My favorite example, though I don't fully understand the math, is using the Thue-Morse Sequence to balance the caffeination (and concentration of flavor compounds*) of pours of coffee. 

Basically, in a drip coffee machine, your brew gets weaker as it gets made (on account of, primarily, the initial extraction taking more time to saturate the bed of grounds before gravity overcomes surface tension) so if you pour your cups in typical sequence they get stronger with each cup (weakest coffee brews last, thus is on the top, thus is served first). However, if you desire greater consistency in caffeination, you can choose to make alternating pours between two cups according to the Thue-Morse Sequence and they'll be roughly equivalent.

3610.0,10.0,Where am I wrong?,take_n0tes,1622606650,"May take some understanding of roulette here.

The odds of winning American roulette by a bet on black or red is 47.37%. By the martingale strategy, if you lose, double your bet, your odds then become 94.74%. I understand the result of bet 1 in no way influences the result of bet 2, but purely from a mathematical perspective this should be the case. 

The martingale strategy doesn’t work because of bet limits, by continually doubling your money eventually you’ll hit the bet limit and it’ll take so long to recover from that loss off small hands that it’s not worth the time. 

But what if you restart every 2 bets? Let’s say you bet $10 on Black, lose, bet $20 on black and lose, then restart at 10. The odds of you losing the $20 bet are statistically 5.26% at which point your total loss would be $30. But you only need to win 3 times to recover the losses and your odds of hitting the $30 loss are roughly 1/19. 

I’m missing where I’m wrong here. By this logic over a long enough period of time you should always profit. Slowly profit, but profit.

However, that is not really the statement of the CLT, which is about convergence of the corresponding distribution functions. Am I missing something or are these common visualisations a bit misleading? Aren't they actually visualising a [local limit theorem](https://encyclopediaofmath.org/wiki/Local_limit_theorems#:~:text=Limit%20theorems%20for%20densities%2C%20that,distributions%2C%20the%20simplest%20of%20which) and not the central limit theorem? After all there are examples, where one has convergence in distribution via the CLT, but no local convergence of the densities. So, the pictures are a special case of convergence in distribution and local convergence at the same time, which the CLT alone does not guarantee. Are there any reasons that explain why the CLT is usually visualised the way it is? Why not just use the distribution functions for the visualisation? 

Even the first sentence in the Wikipedia article on the CLT (""...when independent random variables are added, their properly normalized sum tends toward a normal distribution (informally a ***bell curve***)...""

I am a sophomore at university who finished the calculus sequence + linear algebra, and I am interested in taking the putnam exam at the end of this year (I don't think they have announced the date yet). Though, I have never really done competition math before, so I guess I don't really know/have an instinct as to what strategies can be applied to solving problems (went through a couple past putnam exams). 

So I wanted to ask you guys (especially those who have taken the exam), what resources can I use to pickup this stuff? Do you recommend any books that discusses the strategies used in solving putnam questions?

3705.0,5.0,Have master's in math and can't find a job?,vincetento,1622498448,"I graduated with my master’s in math last year (May 2020) and am seriously struggling to find a job. My MA and BS are both in pure math, and I have two undergraduate minors in finance and actuarial science. I’ve applied to over 100 jobs since graduating and only got 2 interviews, and of those 2 interviews I got 1 offer. Whenever someone asks about my job search they say something to the effect of “well you have a masters in math, you can get hired anywhere!” Turns out that is absolutely NOT the case.

My plan right out of graduate school was to become an adjunct instructor. I’ve applied for math adjunct positions at 2- and 4-year colleges in my area, but with no luck. Teaching at the college level has been my goal, and I have very little desire to teach at the high school/middle school/elementary levels. I am also not certified to teach in my state — based in New Jersey, US — plus, pure math not math education.

I’ve seen similar posts about people with math degrees struggling to find math-related jobs. Many sources online offer advice like “become a statistician” or “get into finance” or “work for the NSA.” These broad statements all sound very enticing and exciting, but apparently hold very little promise. Had I known this sooner, perhaps I would have gotten a degree in statistics or finance instead of pure math. I’ve even applied to work with the NSA (and other federal government agencies) as a mathematician since graduating — they said no.

Almost every job I’ve found outside of academia requires some programming or statistics or finance experience. I have essentially no programming experience (i feel like a liar even listing it on my resume), and my degrees are both in pure math, not applied math or statistics. I’ve applied to various entry-level finance/accounting jobs, and even a handful of internships, and it seems my minors don’t help to get me in there either. These along with all the “entry level math jobs” i’ve searched for on indeed leave me very discouraged.  Here is everything I’m working with:

* high school substitute teacher — the only job offer i’ve received since graduating (Oct 2020-present)
* graduate teaching associate (2017-2019)
* master’s thesis in applied math (Kalman filter; control/estimation/probability theory)
* 1 undergraduate course in Python + very basic use of Python for master’s thesis
* participated in peer mentor program &amp; completed 3-course pedagogy sequence as a graduate student
* undergraduate teaching assistant (2015-2017)
* undergraduate math tutor (2015-2017)
* various retail customer service jobs (2014-2017)

The majority of my experience comes from teaching as a TA and from my master’s thesis research, which are the bulk of my resume. It seems employers don’t really care about the latter. A couple friends I graduated with started teaching at a high school, and I just reached out to another and found they landed a post-grad research fellowship (independent of degree programs). I’ve started looking into some fellowships but it seems most deadlines have already passed for this year, plus I’d feel embarrassed reaching out to my graduate school professors asking for a recommendation so long after graduating.

I am not completely opposed to going back to school. However, I don’t think a PhD program is in the cards for me any time soon. I actually applied to a bunch of programs while in the second year of my masters program and was rejected by every school.

I’ve attributed my non-success over the past months partly to COVID, but now the world is starting to calm down and I’m still jobless. I think another part of this is that I come off as “overqualified” for entry-level jobs because of my education, but also under qualified for anything else because of my work history. Am I missing something here about the math job market? Have other math graduates been just as unsuccessful in finding a job as me? Are there other math-related career paths I have not considered yet? Are there better ways to search for math jobs?  This post ended up being longer than I expected, so thank you if you made it to the end.

That being said, the math department is decently good in that there's (some) good faculty, graduate courses are offered, etc. Also, I realized my interest in pure mathematics a little late (or I probably wouldn't have decided to go through with undergrad at this institution) - but it has become concrete now, and I am very sure of applying to graduate school in pure mathematics.

Almost all the students at my institution are not interested in or fascinated by pure mathematics, and I have been unable to find a peer group of students I can talk about math with. I think such a group is really important for the following reasons: (i) it's a good way to brainstorm on hard problems, rather than being stuck alone, (ii) it's a good way to develop an intuition of abstract concepts and see the same things via different perspectives, (iii) as an undergrad, studying graduate-level courses with a motivated and interested peer group can be more effective than going through them alone.

That's all that I think of off the top of my head, but I think we can safely conclude that the advantages of studying pure mathematics with a like-minded peer group are way too many compared to studying it alone. I have a good relationship with my professors, who are very helpful, but they are certainly not a substitute for a peer group of mathematically inclined students around my age.

**Is there any way I can remedy this? How do I interact with others\* interested in mathematics, as an undergraduate? I would love to meet other undergrads who would be happy to discuss math and learn together, in some sense.**

\*Since this doesn't seem to be an option at my home institution, the next best way would be to develop meaningful connections with like-minded undergrads from other institutions - but I do not know how to do this or if it's even possible.

Conjecture; After this process, there is an infinite amount of G consecutive numbers in A which process did not remove. In other words, there are infinite amount of numbers a in A, for which a, a+1, ..., a+G-1 in A. Somehow the process leaves infinite amount of gaps of length G.

3774.0,74.0,Quantifying how the Thue-Morse sequence is the fairest division sequence,PaboBormot,1622440975,"**Motivation:**

Consider a game in which two shooters take turns shooting at a target. The winner is the one who manages to hit the target first. Say each shot has a relatively small chance of hitting the target. What is the fairest way to take turns?

The Thue Morse sequence is a 0-1 valued sequence that claims to find an answer - this is hard to make precise, but it can be described as “*taking turns taking turns taking turns...*”. 

Using 0 to denote that the first player should shoot and 1 for the second, the sequence is defined by the following iterative process - start with the string 1. At each iteration step, append the *binary complement* of the string to the end. By binary complement I just mean that you turn all 1’s in the string to 0’s and 0’s to 1’s. Thus the sequence of strings starts as follows:

1, 10, 1001, 10010110, ...

The Thue Morse sequence is the infinite string obtained by iterating this process. The full sequence begins:

01101001100101101001011001101001...

Now I would like to quantify the sense in which this is really the fairest turn taking algorithm possible. To this end I propose a few definitions:

**Definitions:**

Define, for each 0-1 valued sequence a*_n_* the *advantage sequence* Va*_n_* as follows:

Va*_n_* := sum (i = 0 to n-1) (-1)^(a*_i_*+1).

Thus Va*_n_* simply records at each step n, how many more turns player 1 has had over player 2, or vice versa - with a + sign signifying that player 1 has had more turns and a - sign for player 2.

Define now for each k ≥ 1, the *k-th order advantage sequence* V^(k)a_n by 

V^(1)a*_n_* := Va*_n_*;

V^(k)a*_n_* := Sum (i = 0 to n-1) V^(k-1)a*_i_*.

 Intuitively, the V^(k) can be understood as follows. 

- V^(1)a records how many more turns player 1 has had (or vice versa) than player 2 thus far.

- V^(2)a records how many times (with multiplicity) player 1 has had more turns than player 2 thus far.

- V^(3)a records how many times player 1 has had more of a second order advantage than player 2 thus far.

... and so on.

Now, let us define a partial order on the set of 0-1 valued sequences as follows: {a*_n_*} ≥ {b*_n_*} if for all n ≥ 0, k ≥ 1, |V^(k)a*_n_*| ≥ |V^(k)b*_n_*|.

We say {a*_n_*} &gt; {b*_n_*} if {a*_n_*}  ≥ {b*_n_*} but not vice versa.

Now we are ready to state the problem. Denote by {T*_n_*} the Thue-Morse sequence. Is the following true?

**Conjecture:** {T*_n_*} &gt; {a*_n_*} for any other 0-1 valued sequence {a*_n_*} such that a*_0_* = 1. Thus the Thue-Morse sequence is the unique sequence that minimises all the higher order advantages.",math

I talked to my friends, and, as far as I understand, in most other countries people don't have calculus either - in Russia and France, for instance, everyone also starts with analysis. What is even the point for mathematicians to learn a non-rigorous version of a subject if they must learn a rigorous version later on anyway? Isn't it better to make the subject rigorous from the start and guarantee that people will learn how to rigorously prove statements from the first day in the university?

I have a question for you. I recently discovered the passion for maths to the point that i would like to study mathematics.

After some research (and HOLY SHIT, THERE IS NO INFORMATION ABOUT MATH'S PhD ON THE INTERNET in my country) I have questions and uncertainties in this area.

What are you really doing ? (Everybody responds, lol you won't like that, so i guess this is some sort of secret only mathematicians can know xD)

Is there jobs for PhD or bacc in mathematics ?

If you work as a data analysist what is a typical journey or yours ? How much do you use math ?

If you work as a teacher, what is a typical journey or yours ?

Is a bachelor worth it ?

Is a PhD worth it ?

Is applied mathematics way better than pure mathematics (in terms of professional opportunities) ?

Should i just learn maths on the side of my actual studies instead of full time studies?

I know there is a lot of question, but every time I asked these questions, the only answers I received are ""LOL, every body can do calculus"" or downvote. Please, don't do that. It does not help ...

I hope you are true mathmaticians and you can answers some of my questions.

Thank you for your answers.

It also presents a table (and stores it in a csv file) with the numbers as it has to do the numerical solution in order to plot it.

Thought it might be useful for anyone studying math methods or this model as a visual tool. The way it solves it is by Runge-Kutta integration so that is very interesting too.

My thought for today is the x, y, and zed axial representation of a 3 dimensional object. However we can really add another axis at that point. 

Which got me thinking, is it possible to bend the axis themselves almost as a representation of a gravitational mass in the specific region? 

The graph elsewhere stays the same, but where that massive object is, do you think it’s possible to bend the x,y, and zed axis respective to the gravitational force that object exhibits? 

And how would that affect the points or view of the graph? You’d have to adjust every single point in accordance with the distortion, I don’t know sounded interesting.",math

3806.0,6.0,The smallest 'greedy' number base,rumnscurvy,1622404495,"This is most likely a well known result, but it's a cute little property of number bases I thought about while dosing in the sun over the weekend. 

I call a 'greedy' number base one where the greedy algorithm is the natural way to express (non-decimal) numbers in that base. I.e., the lead digit of X in base b is obtained by finding the biggest power of b that fits in X, then the biggest power of b that fits in the remainder etc. This is the 'usual' way we think about numbers and number bases because integer bases all have that property. 

The converse, a non greedy base, is a base where you can knock off a higher power of the base to express it in terms of lower powers. This happens, for instance, for the Golden Ratio base: since 𝜑^2 = 𝜑 +1, the number 100_𝜑 can be rewritten 011_𝜑. This isn't greedy, while both are valid representations, somehow 𝜑^2 isn't 'big' enough to represent an entirely new category of numbers the previous ones can't express. 

So, the question is, which bases are greedy and which aren't? It's pretty clear that if a base b1 is greedy, then a base b2 &gt; b1 is greedy also (the respective powers of the bases are also thus ordered). The contraposition of this statement means that if b1 is ungreedy then b2 &lt; b1 is also ungreedy. Since both sets are non empty (we found one of each respectively), we would like to know about the boundary of those spaces, if there is a largest nongreedy number or a smallest greedy number or neither.

Well, by following along the reasoning for the Golden Ratio, we certainly should have 

b^2 &gt; b+1

because otherwise the base stops being greedy after the third digit. By extension we desire

b^n &gt; b^n^-^1 + .. + b + 1 

because otherwise n+1 digit numbers can be rewritten in an ungreedy way. 

The real positive roots of the equations x^n = x^n^-^1 + ... +x+1 form an increasing sequence (we can expect this by the ordering properties explained in the previous paragraph): by using a summation identity, we have 

 1  - (1- 1/x^n) / (1-x) = 0

Which can be shown to be positive and increasing and also bounded by 2 by the above. Therefore it must have a limit, which it clearly does since 1/x^n tends to zero for x&gt;1, which we assume since we're talking about number bases. Thus we find the limit (since it exists) obeys 1 - 1/(1-x) = 0, which solves to

x = 2


Summing up: for any base x smaller than 2, there will exist an n such that x^n &lt;= x^n^-^1 + ... + x + 1, so it is ungreedy. 2 is greedy, therefore it is the least such base.",math

After a recent college algebra class I took, I have gone from absolutely hating math to completely and utterly adoring it. I bought a whiteboard and practice equations almost everyday for months now.

3827.0,27.0,Cup of Noodles is lying to you (I think),PaintedHatchet,1622368082,"The cup of noodles website for the My Cup of Noodles Factory claims that their are “5,460 flavor combinations”, but I think they calculated this wrong. 

The website states that “In a cup that you design, select your favorite soup from among four varieties and four toppings from among 12 ingredients.” 

A key assumption that I am making is that doubling a topping does NOT count as a new flavor. This would count the same as taking 3 toppings. For instance: 1, 1, 2, 3 is the same as 1, 2, 3. 

nCr will be a shorthand used for combinations. Combinations were used because I believe order of items (toppings) selected does not matter. 

So because there are 4 varieties of soup flavoring, I will multiply by 5 at the end (assuming a 5th flavor is no flavoring added). 

Now to jump into combinations. 

If you select 4 toppings, this would be a 12 nCr 4 combination. Which equals 495. 

If you select only 3 toppings, this would be a 12 nCr 3 combination. Which equals 220. 

2 toppings: 12 nCr 2 = 66 

1 topping: 12 nCr 1 = 12 

No topping: 1 nCr 1 = 1 

Add all of the topping combos: 495 + 220 + 66 + 12 + 1 = 794. 

Multiple by soup choices: 794 * 5 = 3970. 

By my calculation there are 3970 flavor combinations. This would mean the 5,460 combination claim is incorrect. 

Let me know if I miscalculated or your theories for how they arrived at 5,460.",math

I was thinking about Tychonoff's theorem and began to wonder about why it's the case that the Axiom of Choice is necessary in the proof. I know that choice is equivalent to Tychonoff's theorem so it really is fundamental to use it in some sort of form. However, in a soft sense is the major obstruction to a proof of Tychonoff's theorem without choice the fact that without it we can't even prove that the arbitrary product of topological spaces is nonempty? I mean say we ignore choice. Then we can still prove that finite (and I think countable as well) products of compact spaces are still compact. However for the full strength of the theorem, is it that we just can't reach those spaces without choice?

I'm planning to write a book or at least a paper on something I'm researching and as part of that I wanted to perform some modelling of one of the concepts, but I'm slightly stuck with how to mathematically find this and then generate it in software.

**The problem:**

On a flat surface, you can drawn [this set of lines](https://i.imgur.com/NYfd7ir.png). If you imagine it as a set of paths, the distance from the centre section with the spur to each end point is the same length and you can add extra sets of ""H"" shaped lines to each end point to create more end points while maintaining the requirement that the path length from the centre be the same. The end points are also the same distance from each other.

Lets call this shape an H-manifold. I'm using the engineering definition of a manifold here because in this problem these lines actually represents channels on a surface, but taking a look at Wikipedia this shape might also meet the topology definition of a manifold too?

How would you go about creating an equivalent manifold on a half-sphere? I believe this is a question of topology, but I don't know enough about the topic to be sure.

3875.0,75.0,"A ""revolution"" in PDE, distributional calculus, and Sato's hyperfunctions",catuse,1622318230,"In this post I want to talk about one of the basic ideas in the analysis of PDE: weak solutions.

(This post grew out of a Quick Question I had, and didn't get a response to beyond u/grothendieck1 responding that they had the same question. It's also something of a response to the recent discussion about whether algebraic geometry is particularly prone to revolutions -- the use of low-regularity solutions seems like a comparable development in the analysis of PDE.)

When one studies differential equations it quickly becomes apparent that restricting to analytic or even smooth functions is just not feasible. A few examples:

* Pretending that the Dirac delta ""function"" is actually a function allows us to at least formally solve many linear PDE. If P is a linear differential operator and PK = \delta then the Fourier transform of the equation PK = \delta is an algebraic equation that can be solved explicitly for the Fourier transform of K. Then, if u is the convolution u = K * f, then Pu = f.
* A smooth function u solves the Euler-Lagrange equations for some action I subject to some boundary data v iff u is a minimizer of I with respect to the constraint v. A priori there is no reason for a minimizer to be smooth, however, so the Euler-Lagrange equations may make no sense in general. Hilbert's 19th problem implies that minimizers are analytic subject to certain constraints on I. The hard part of the solution is de Giorgi-Nash-Moser theory, which says that if u is a Lipschitz minimizer and I is ""regular"" then \nabla u has a positive Hölder exponent -- once we get past the threshold of Hölder gradients, the rest is not bad.
* Stochastic PDE allow one to model systems with white noise, but the derivative of white noise is Brownian motion, which is about as far from a smooth function as possible (in fact its Hölder exponent is &lt; 0.5).

Owing to these considerations and others, one is led to the notion of ""weak solution"", a function that satisfies an *integral* version of a PDE. For example, u solves the Laplace equation \Delta u = f iff for every smooth function \psi of compact support (briefly, every *test function* \psi), the integral of \nabla u, \nabla \psi is f. If a weak solution is smooth, then it honestly satisfies the PDE, so weak solutions are generalizations of ""strong"" (i.e. smooth) solutions.

In the 1950s Laurent Schwartz isolated the notion of '''distribution''' on an open set (or manifold) \Omega: a bounded linear functional on the space of test functions on \Omega. If u is a locally L^1 function then u is a distribution, in the sense that the integral of u(x) \psi(x) dx is a bounded linear functional in \psi. More generally, any Radon measure \mu is a distribution (identifying \mu with \psi(x) d\mu(x)). However, we can define the derivative of a distribution \langle u, -\rangle by *defining* the integral of u'(x) \psi(x) dx to be -\int u(x) \psi'(x) dx. In other words, distributions are ""anything that satisfies the integration by parts formula"".

Example: The Dirac delta is a Radon measure, and therefore a distribution. If we integrate \psi(x) \delta(x) dx, we get back \psi(0). However, the derivative of \delta is NOT a Radon measure, but it still is a distribution, which returns -\psi'(0).

One can define the *order* of a distribution u to be the number of times one needs to differentiate a Radon measure to get u. There exist distributions of infinite order -- think of \delta(x) + \delta'(x - 1)/2 + \delta''(x - 2)/4 + ... -- but all distributions are locally of finite order.

The most powerful application of distributions, as far as I'm aware of, is Hörmander's propagation of singularities theorem, the culmination of his theory of Fourier integral operators. One first defines the notion of a *wavefront set* of a distribution on a manifold X, which is a subset of the cosphere bundle of X (which is the manifold which consists of points (x, \omega) where x \in X and \omega is the set of ""directions that momenta of particles with position x can point in""). Essentially, the fiber of WF u at x is nonempty iff u fails to be smooth in all neighborhoods of x, and the members of the fiber are ""the directions in which the higher directional derivatives of u fail to be continuous"". Propagation of singularities says that, if one runs a linear PDE with initial data u, then WF u moves according to the Hamiltonian flow with energy a, where a is the ""symbol"" of the PDE -- the top-order term of the polynomial one obtains by taking the Fourier transform of the PDE. The study of propagation of singularities and similar results is known as *microlocal analysis*, because one not only localizes the function to a point x, but to a subset of the momenta based at x.

(Technical aside: Actually, one defines WF u as a subset of the cotangent bundle, but WF u is conic, so doing so doesn't make a whole lot of sense.)

Example: The wave equation with initial position \delta and no initial velocity. Since WF u consists of a cosphere at the origin and all other fibers are empty, propagation of singularities tells us that we should expect u(t) to be singular along the lightcone x^2 = t^(2), which is exactly what happens.

Around the same time that Hörmander was developing Fourier integral operators, Sato introduced the notion of a *hyperfunction*. Given an open subset U of **R** (say), we let the hyperfunctions on U be pairs of holomorphic functions (f, g), f defined on {x + iy: x \in U, y &gt; 0} and g on {x \in U, y &lt; 0}, where we identify (f, g) with (f + h, g + h) whenever h is defined on all of {x + iy: x \in U}. Every distribution u defines a hyperfunction, namely f(z) is the integral of u(x) dx/(2pi i(z - x)) and g = -f. But (e^(z), e^(z)) is a hyperfunction which is not a distribution, since the essential singularity at 0 implies that e^z is not even locally of finite order.

A nice feature of hyperfunctions is that if Pu = f is a PDE with *analytic* coefficients and f is a hyperfunction, then u exists and is a hyperfunction. Hyperfunctions do come with their own notion of wavefront set, that can be used to detect when a PDE has analytic solutions. But, in spite of Hilbert's 19th problem, my intuition is that this should not really happen unless circumstances are extremely good (the PDE should be linear with analytic coefficients and inhomogeneity).

I was curious about what else one can do with hyperfunctions. The best I could find is this MathOverflow post - https://mathoverflow.net/questions/215445/applications-and-main-properties-of-hyperfunctions - but other than a reference to Chapter 9 of Hörmander's book (c.f. the previous paragraph) the only thing in that MO post is that the sheaf of hyperfunctions is injective, but the sheaf of distributions is not. This raises more questions than answers. When does one need to use sheaf cohomology to study PDE -- and, given that, why would one be specifically interested in injective sheaves? The sheaf of distributions admits partitions of unity, and surely that's enough in applications.

Anyways, the actual point of this post is to ask for literature where Sato's hyperfunctions are used. This is interesting to me in its own right, but additionally, an algebraist once told me that PDE people and algebraic geometers working on D-modules, etc., should talk to each other, but don't. I figure trying to make sense of what I can do with the algebraic side of microlocal analysis would be a good place to start in bridging the gap.",math

[A screenshot of the ACC2021 conference SpacialChat system. Blurring is my own.](https://preview.redd.it/jbc1est5f2271.png?width=4029&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=74e79e4402fb5975aeebb8b73c11933dda101eed)

So yesterday wrapped up the American Control Conference 2021 that was held virtually at New Orleans. This basically means that they had a bunch of pretty purple pictures of New Orleans on their website and I wasn't able to get any cajun food.

I've been to a few conferences since the pandemic started. I feel like I didn't get a lot out of them. This is partly because I'm trading childcare duties with my wife as we both work, and it's hard to have the real one on one conversations that you have at a conference. The 2020 ACC was moved to an online format through Zoom, and my colleague, Rushi and I conducted a workshop in that setting. It was ok, but even the speakers didn't hang around long after their talks, and that sort of killed any collaborations we were hoping to engender.

ACC2021 was different. It wasn't stellar, but it was different. Initially, the format was so different that I laughed and brought my wife over to look at this ""circus"" of a conference on my screen. I was a little bubble hopping around the screen among other bubbles. Other bubbles could chase you down to talk with you. There were posters that we were landing on, circles on the screen, and it seemed ludicrous. There was a little theater on the screen that showed our extremely short presentations on a loop, where my two 3 minute videos came on with a splash. (I am quite proud of them, for what they are. Here is an example: [https://youtu.be/kp-vhGPL5L0](https://youtu.be/kp-vhGPL5L0)).

After toying with it for a while, I found that my interactions were actually a lot closer to what I would have had at a normal conference. You could only hear the conversation of little bubbles you were next to, and this allowed you to get some one on one time, despite having a bunch of other people present in the room. In the end, I found this setup interesting and effective. I might have even scored two new collaborations out of it. Time will tell on that last item.

Also, there didn't seem to be any gating for attendance. I didn't log into anything in particular, just put my name down and it let me in.

What do you think of this style of online conference? It's not the same as in person, but all considering, I think it was a decent approach to the problem. Did anyone else attend ACC2021? How do you think it compared to last year's ACC?",math

And so on.

In fact, it seems that for every square number k^2, applying this *thing* to the number k^2-k (132, for example, is 12^2-12) will converge onto k.

If you treat m as rows and n as columns, if m is a perfect power, the entire row of numbers have already been defined in a previous row. For example, the entire row for m=4 has already been defined by m=2.

Are there any other numbers already defined in a similar manner for rational numbers with a numerator of 1? How about for numerator &gt; 1?",math

* Apply to ENS Paris this upcoming year. If I am accepted, I go for three years.
* Apply to Cambridge Part III my senior year. If I am accepted, I go for nine months.

But my problem is that I cannot tell which would be better for me (assuming I get into either). I am interested in **pure math**, specifically **diff/algebraic topology, number theory,** and I think soon **category theory**, specifically topos theory. 

A concern I have is that, from [their course prospectus](http://www.math.ens.fr/enseignement/catalogue_en.html?annee=2020-2021#), the students at ENS don't have a lot of course options. Which I guess is to be expected, since the program is small. But still, that worries me, maybe because I'm a US student who is so used to taking 5-8 courses at any given time. I wish there was more to read about students' experiences at both programs.",math

Whatever program you write on this computer, if your program halts, it will take no longer than 1 second to resolve. If you wrote something with an infinite loop, you would know for sure after one second. 

So, for example, you could write a program that verifies Goldbach's Conjecture by checking that every even number greater than two is the sum of two primes, and returning the first counterexample it finds. If it takes longer than a second to find a counterexample, then the Goldbach's Conjecture holds. You could do something similar for the Riemann Hypothesis!

Also you could do things that would take an absurd amount of computational power, such as studying the long term behavior of Conway's Game of Life across huge (but finite) spaces at different starting densities.

The video claims that this means, for example, that it's possible that the Twin Prime conjecture is unprovable.

4010.0,10.0,How can Monty Hall not be 50/50?,sixeco,1622136017,"Let me explain first what my understanding is of the problem, in case its the wrong setup in my head.

Youre at a game show. You'll get 3 doors, 1 has the prize, 2 have a goat. You get to chose first, you chose a door. The host then choses a door, opens it, and shows it's a goat, because he knows where the prize is. Now he asks you based on the new information ""Do you want to chose a different door?""

The problem lies within ""should you switch to the other unknown door?""

So far I've discussed this numerous times and I still cant get a straight answer why it's not 50/50. Usually people just rely on made up rules that are supposed to work in this scenario.

People always say that its 2/3 since at the beginning my chance of chosing right is 1/3, so far so good. Then they say that since one door was revealed to be a goat, that 2/3 move to the other door that is not revealed.

I am incredibly frustrated because of this, since I completely understand how people might think that is correct, but it's still wrong to me. Here's why:

At the beginning it's 1/3 for each door. The host choses a goat door. He cant chose yours, since that would end the game and you couldnt chose again. He cant chose the prize door out of the same reason.

Once the last goat door is eliminated, that door becomes irrelevant to the second choice that is offered. 

That makes both events of choice independent events. The only way how it can be 66% for the other door is if you still consider the revealed door as a valid option, which is technically correct for the games rules. But noone in their right mind would do that, so you're actually only ever left with the options you have no information about. Which at the end is either a goat or the prize, which is 50/50.

The outcome of the game is irrelevant to this, since you'd be reconsidering all options that were available at the beginning again. That would result in a statistical outcome, not the actual winning chance.

A different way to look at this is in an urn experiment. There are 3 balls in the urn, one is a win, the other 2 are a loss. You pick one out, the host picks out a loss out of the rest so 1 is left. Then he asks if you want the other ball. The probability would be reduced to the options left, which is 50/50.",math

I will use [this](https://www.random.org/dice/?num=4) dice roll simulator to decide the allocation of teams.

I will then repeat this process for all 22 people taking part. Each person then receives points determined by the performance of each of their four teams.

""**Lemma.** 2 is a prime number

**Proof.** We attempt to factor 2; that is, to write 2=ab for some natural numbers a and b; to show 2 is prime means we'll show either a=1 or b=2. Now the product of any two natural numbers is at least as large as either factor, so we have a=&lt;2 and b=&lt;2. Since a and b are natural numbers, 1=&lt;a and 1=&lt;b. So we have 1=&lt;a=&lt;2 and 1=&lt;b=&lt;2. But the only natural numbers between 1 and 2 (inclusive) are 1 and 2. So either a=1 or a=2.""

Why is this sufficient?

When I prove that a=1 or a=2 I can still freely choose what b can be, can't I? Why is this the thing that is proven and is it enough?

I think I understand the proof.. But not the premise.

So, I have learned pi always as 3.1415926535897932384626433832795028841972 (that is the extent I have remembered).

But, this cosmic pi thing I will copy and paste into this post: 3.14644660941. 

I saw someone comment on some post thing (different website) that this was the ""True"" pi. Well, I was confused. I delved further, and it seems all I can find about it is 5 things.

1. This is only used by supercomputers and/or regular computer
2. This is the ""true"" pi
3. Something about it being formed from the square root of pi. No one was really clear on that.
4. Found in March 1998. (This appears a weird amount of times)
5. RasberryPi made a computer with the same name. Either because the creators made it as a reference or not, it hindered my search for a few minutes.

A little more delving, Pi is just an approximation. From a polygon that resembles a circle, but just has a bunch of sides, while cosmic pi is from a circle. 

I am going to make an assumption that cosmic pi is a true circle, but traditional pi is because there are so much tiny things like atoms that things can't truly be a circle. But, they wouldn't be so different, would they?

So was my memorizing a bad idea? If so, then why do we use it instead of Cosmic Pi?",math

4118.0,18.0,The Future of the Mathematician and Cal Newport's Deep Work,Evariste72,1622043953,"Deep Work is book written by Cal Newport, a computer science professor at Georgetown University. The book focuses on the idea of *deep work*—the ability to focus without distractions on a cognitively demanding task. Many of the books ideas are centered around the Deep Work Hypothesis, which I won't explain as I don't want the post to be too verbose. 

The *very, very* brief synopsis aside...I wanted to bring up an aspect of the book, which I found particularly interesting, and its potential importance for mathematics as a career field. I think it is important to note that I have not finished the book yet, so there may be details I am missing. Cal identifies two core abilities for excelling in the modern economy. 

* The ability to quickly master hard things.
* The ability to produce at an elite level, in terms of both quality and speed. 

As it is relevant, I am not a professional mathematician, but rather currently in my undergrad. However, I do have aspirations of being a professional mathematician and plan to go onto a PhD after my undergrad. Given these aspirations, I couldn't help but view the above bullet points in relation to mathematics as a career field. I also thought it would be cool to hear other's viewpoints on it, as there are many more experienced than I. 

I can't help but think that we are in a truly marvelous time in history, *especially* for mathematics. Never before in history have human beings had such an immense reservoir of mathematical knowledge at their fingertips like online textbooks, Wikipedia, millions of YouTube videos, and forums like Reddit. In comparison, students and mathematician of centuries past had sparse exposure to materials to learn mathematics. This scenario is where I feel like the ability to quickly master hard things comes into play. 

With the abundance of mathematical material, I feel as if the greatest mathematicians of the future will be those who can leverage this massive reservoir of knowledge quickly and effectively to solve ever-evolving and difficult problems. As I am not in the career field yet, I am very curious on the community's thoughts on this. What do you think? 

As a side note, a whole other topic that I do not know much about is that of artificial intelligence in mathematical discovery. I can imagine this will greatly affect the mathematics career field. To clarify, I mean not in that artificial intelligence will eliminate mathematicians, but artificial intelligence will be a powerful tool in mathematical discovery (or invention if you subscribe to that).

For the second bullet point, I felt this was interesting in reference to our fast-paced, dopamine-heavy society in which we find ourselves. As Cal mentions in his book, the ability to focus deeply is a vital and increasingly valuable asset in our modern economy. I think mathematics is the epitome of this, as one must think carefully and deeply about a difficult problem to solve it. I often find myself distracted by social media, YouTube, or Reddit, which I have realized greatly hurts my productivity. As before, I think the greatest mathematicians in the future will be those who resist the temptation of these distractions. What are your thoughts? 

If you have stuck with this for so long, thank you! As mentioned before, I have not finished the book yet. But, I have found it very interesting and will most definitely finish it. I would recommend it!",math

4144.0,44.0,I wanted to study Mathematics because I love it - but it's one of the main causes of my anxiety now,vangmay231,1622022991,"Hi. First of all, yes I have been taking professional help for my anxiety. I'm not sure if this is the best place to post this, but I'm not sure what is so I'll do it anyway. 

I took Maths for college because I fell in love with it in the last year of my school. I wasn't much good at it or into it before that, but my punt came off as I loved abstract Math and really got into it. The first Analysis course followed by an Abstract Algebra course made me feel it was the right choice. I used to study because I loved it. 

I'm in India, and a lot of higher courses are all dependent on Entrance Examinations. I started preparing for my [M.Sc](https://M.Sc) Entrance Exam in May 2018 - and I don't think there's been a day since then that I've stopped putting pressure on myself about Mathematics. Once I decided I was going to do this for the rest of my life, I constantly feel I'm not doing enough in the subject to be successful in that path.

I couldn't get a good place for my Master's, so I took a break year and prepped again and got into a better place. However, that's also when the pandemic started. One year into an online [M.Sc](https://M.Sc), in a college that puts immense pressure on its students, along with a ton of physical symptoms of anxiety popping up, I can barely hold on. On top of this, I had figured in my head that I want to do a PhD, and the thought of applying abroad for it with so little information and so few people to talk to while being at home in lockdown, it has piled on so much.

I feel at times I forget why I picked Maths in the first place. I enjoy it, I love it. Even during all this, when I could genuinely study - like I did for my Measure Theory exam the last week - I enjoyed every bit of it. But with all the context and life decisions that have tagged along with it, my own insecurities with the subject, and the freakin pandemic - it's all too big of a mountain to handle. 

Along with this, I suffer from a couple of sleep disorders. That along with anxiety and its physical effect means that often I just can't focus and concentrate at all to study. Today is one of those days, but I have to study because I have an exam on Graduate Algebra in 3 days. I have one more year of my Master's, and I honestly feel I need to get away from a structured Mathematics course for a while for me to have a better relationship with the subject - and a better relationship with myself possibly. 

My end goal is to teach Maths at the university level, but maybe I need to move from that and be more open to other possibilities. I would love to work on Math Education as well - research in pedagogy etc. Because as of now the mental toll of me studying the subject itself has just become too much. 

I just wanted to talk about my experience. Any advice, any stories of your relationship with the subject - I would be very grateful for.",math

This knowledge and ability to think in terms of abstractions constantly makes me dumbfounded by this one fundamental question. What is a Number? 

A number can encompass so many abstractions. A number can be discrete making it mean something specific. For example, a doughnut has *One* hole and a genus 2 object has *two* holes. Over here the one and two are discrete but they exist by themselves. A number can be continuous meaning that it can be irrational like pi or something else.  It's something we can't grasp but it still exists. 

So in that light what is a number? Is a number an abstraction we use to quantify measurement in the world (meaning that it is an imagination of our mind ) or it is an entity that exists by itself?

4166.0,66.0,"Question on Law of joint Probability, and what happens to P(A and B)",CabbageInstitution,1621984886," 

I was recently studying for the FE exam, and I came across this problem. The problem solution they give states to refer to the law of compound or joint probability.

However, I been looking at it, and I am having trouble understanding **what happens to P(A and B).**

The question is as follows:

1. A player has a 70% chance to play the game for a 3 days
2. A player has a 60% chance to play the game for a week

What is the probability that they will play the game given that they played the game for a week?

The answer they give is as follows, first they refer to the NCEE reference manual which shows

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rnjbsxd9oc171.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7157c25846874d7ec6cd9acc7940a93bc7bc38ae

Then they state

P(A)= .70, 70% likely to play the game for a 3 days

P(B) = 0.60, 60% likely to play the game for a week

P(A and B) = P(A) P(B|A) = P(B) P(A | B)

~~P(A and B) =~~ 0.95 (0.8) = P(B) *P(A | B)*

They say P(A|B) is 1 since A is not affected by B. 

~~P(A and B) =~~ .7 P(B|A) = 0.6 *(1)*

which would mean P(B|A) = 0.857

**But my questions are:**

1. what does P(A and B) which is 0.7 \*0.6=0.42 represent? (this makes more sense in the alternative version written later in this email)
2. Why is P (A and B) not be used? (is it cause in order to do so A and B must be independent events?)
3. When can P(A and B) be used in the law of compound or joint probability?
4. Does the whole equation from the NCEES reference manual P(A and B) = P(A) P(B|A) = P(B) P(A | B) have to be true, or can parts of it be eliminated depending on the situation.
5. Is it because in order for P( A and B) to be valid, does P(B) have to be a percentage of P(A) or of the whole (this question is due to the other example below)
6. Is this actually joint probability, or is conditional?

Extra:

I also found the following example online:

📷

**This would suggest that an alternative version of the original problem would be**

P(A)= .7 , A player has a 70% chance to play the game for a 3 days

P(B|A) = 0.6 , out of the ones who played it for 3 days, there is 60% chance the player will play the game for a week

P(A and B) = 0.42 Total number of users who use it for a month

P(A and B) = P(A) P(B|A) = P(B) P(A | B)

.42 = .7 P(B|A) = ~~0.8~~ *~~P(A | B)~~*

0.42 = 0.7 (0.6) = ~~P(B)~~ *~~P(A | B)~~*

which would mean P(B|A) = 0.6, which is equal to P(B). Makes sense to me

**If we found P(A|B), it would be 0.7. This would mean that P(A|B)= P(A), which makes sense in the manner that P(A) is not affected by P(B), but wouldnt this mean A is independent of B, but not vice versa?**",math

The answer they give is as follows, first they refer to the NCEE reference manual which shows

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/tgmz1fu3nc171.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=697bee8032cd8465b4ca0ec832a63cc11773c86b

Then they state

P(A)= .70,  70% likely to play the game for a 3 days

P(B) = 0.60,  60% likely to  play the game for a week

P(A and B) = P(A) P(B|A) = P(B) P(A | B)

~~P(A and B) =~~ 0.95 (0.8) = P(B) *P(A | B)*

They say P(A|B) is 1 since A is not affected by B. 

~~P(A and B) =~~ .7 P(B|A) = 0.6 *(1)*

which would mean P(B|A) = 0.857 

**But my questions are:**

1. what does P(A and B) which is 0.7 \*0.6=0.42 represent? (this makes more sense in the alternative version written later in this email)
2. Why is P (A and B) not be used? (is it cause in order to do so A and B must be independent events?)
3. When can P(A and B) be used in the law of compound or joint probability?
4. Does the whole equation from the NCEES reference manual P(A and B) = P(A) P(B|A) = P(B) P(A | B) have to be true, or can parts of it be eliminated depending on the situation.
5. Is it because in order for P( A and B) to be valid, does P(B) have to be a percentage of P(A) or of the whole (this question is due to the other example below)
6. Is this actually joint probability, or is conditional?

**This would suggest that an alternative version of the original problem would be**

P(A)= .7 ,   A player has a 70% chance to play the game for a 3 days

P(B|A) = 0.6   , out of the ones who played it for 3 days,  there is 60% chance the player will play the game for a week

P(A and B) = 0.42 Total number of users who use it for a month

P(A and B) = P(A) P(B|A) = P(B) P(A | B)

.42 = .7 P(B|A) = ~~0.8~~ *~~P(A | B)~~*

0.42 = 0.7 (0.6) = ~~P(B)~~ *~~P(A | B)~~*

which would mean P(B|A) = 0.6, which is equal to P(B). Makes sense to me

**If we found P(A|B), it would be 0.7. This would mean that P(A|B)= P(A), which makes sense in the manner that P(A) is not affected by P(B), but wouldnt this mean A is independent of B, but not vice versa?**",math

The answer they give is as follows

P(A)= .95  95% likely to use the app for 1 week 

P(B) = 0.8  80% likely to use the app for 1 month 

P(A and B) = P(A) P(B|A) = P(B) P(A | B) 

~~P(A and B) =~~ 0.95 (0.8) = P(B) *P(A | B)* 

They say P(A|B) is 1 since A is not affected by B. 

~~P(A and B) =~~ .95 P(B|A) = 0.8 *(1)* 

which would mean P(B|A)  = 0.84 as they say.  

**But my questions are:** 

1. what does  P(A and B) which is  0.95 \*0.8=0.76 represent? (It shouldnt actually mean anything, unlike in the alternative version later in this email)
2. Why is P (A and B) not be used? (is it cause in order to do so A and B must be independent events?)
3. When can P(A and B) be used?
4. Does the whole equation from the NCEES reference manual P(A and B) = P(A) P(B|A) = P(B) P(A | B) have to be true, or can parts of it be eliminated depending on the situation.
5. Is it because in order for P( A and B) to be valid, does P(B) have to be a percentage of P(A) or of the whole (this question is due to the other example below)
6. Is this actually joint probability, or is conditional?

I was wondering if anyone had read this Vector Calculus book. Paul was one of my favourite lecturers at university, his enthusiasm was really entertaining and I particularly liked his class on bifurcation theory. (I also find the idea of owning books written by lecturers who taught you quite exciting) 

A bit of background, I did a four year degree at the University of Nottingham, and took applied maths modules throughout. But I had one fatal flaw, I absolutely sucked at vector calculus. In the end I went towards the nonlinear differential equations side of things but I always thought that vector calculus is something incredibly important for a mathematician, something that I should add to my toolkit at one stage or another. 

Having a non maths job at the moment, I find myself drawn to learning the stuff I missed at university.

I have some mathematics based questions that I thought would be well placed here for further discussion. I've recently become interested in the unidentified aerial phenomena footage that the US defence department has just authenticated as coming from the Navy, and I was wondering whether, given the information on the displays that are shown in the videos, one would be able to work out any further information about the objects in question. 

What I would like to work out specifically is the size of the object, but everything and anything that can be worked out with the given information would also be of interest as well! I will link some pictures and list the figures that are given below:

[This is the ""gofast"" object in question](https://youtu.be/VUrTsrhVce4)

[This illustrates what the information on the display means](https://imgur.com/CW0aWp3)

&amp;#x200B;

**Information Shown on ATFLIR Display:** 

* Angle at which the sensor is pointing relative to the aircrafts axis: 
   * 35° left of axis

&amp;#x200B;

* Slant range from sensor to object:
   * 4.1 Nautical miles

&amp;#x200B;

* Calibrated airspeed of the aircraft:
   * Mach number 0.61, equates to 747.2768 km/h
      * *I should mention that there is a discrepancy with the image that i linked which lists a mach number of 0.61 and equates this to 252 knots? I'm not too sure what to make of this as they are not equivalent as far as I'm aware...*

&amp;#x200B;

* Sensor elevation relative to the aircraft's axis:
   * \- 22° (22° below the aircraft's axis) 

&amp;#x200B;

* Field of view of sensor:
   * 1.5° x 1.5° with 1x optical zoom
      * *I can't link the site that I think shows the field of view of the sensor, but if you google (in quotation marks so that the specific phrase results show) ""Infrared functions are provided in the A/A master mode"", then the Google OneBox option that is displayed is where I got the figures for the field of view from, they are in the first paragraph on the website.* 
      * *I'm also not sure whether these figures are directly relevant to the ATFLIR system that captured this footage as the figures described are for an A/A Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR) system. It's not made especially clear whether this is the same system as the ATFLIR (Advanced Targeting Forward Looking Infrared), maybe someone will be able to shed some more light on this?*

Find the shortest sequence of digits to describe numbers.

I'm writing out the answers to some stupid exam with easy questions that no longer interest me. It's been months since I last managed to read more than 5 pages from a maths book, or hell enjoy much things at all. (The only thing that sometimes keeps me entertained is bullet chess).

After years and years of being passionate about maths, and everything about it, from the education system teaching me that my love for not calculating things out is wrong, to being rejected by every higher-educational institution I actually wanted to go (both for BSc and Masters), it seems this is the final straw. The thrill I used to get after that last nice  step in the proof is gone for me, and I don't know what to do. My whole life was meant to be based around mathematics, but it feels like every time I take a step in that direction, the mathematical world pushes back against me.

I used to get very involved in projects. It seems every time I do, I am a burden to professors there, not someone they enjoy talking to about random interesting intricacies, the way I was. Meanwhile, all sorts of further study programs don't seem to care about my clear passion, my grades, or anything, just choosing me to reject me with the standard ""we are too busy to even bother giving feedback"" (and oh, I have tried).

4273.0,73.0,Is there any defence of actual infinity?,funsociety7,1621885493,"Hi, I'm learning about Aristotle's distinction between actual and potential infinities. As I understand it, he finds that potential infinities, which are kind of like the hypothetical imagined construct of infinity, do exist, eg saying that numbers are infinite, but the moment potential infinities are brought into reality, a space that has a beginning and end, it becomes impossible, for reasons such as infinity divided by two produces two equal numbers, or infinity plus one is the same as just infinity because infinity is already complete - this defies the rules of mathematics. 

This seems pretty undeniable, but I keep finding mentions of mathematicians that might disagree with this, like Leibniz saying ""I am so in favour of actual infinity"" and possibly Georg Cantor? The reason why I say ""might"" and ""possibly"" is because I am not a maths person so when I try to read up on the arguments that these people are actually making, they make no sense to me... This might just be me getting confused and misinterpreting things, but are there really any arguments in defence of actual infinity, or any mathematicians that have even tried to argue, however wrongly, in its defence? And do any of these arguments come close to holding up?

4274.0,74.0,A fun example of undecidable system: iterated multiplication and digit rewriting,ImportantContext,1621884734,"Just something I noticed and thought people here might find it curious too: 

Suppose you have some constant, let's call it `M`, and a function `f(n)` that maps the set of digits in base b to itself.

Let's also define `F(x)` as the result of replacing each digit of `x` with output of `f(n)` for that digit.

Given an initial value A, we can construct a sequence: 

`x_0 = A`

`x_n = F(M * x_(n-1))`

Despite this family of sequences being seemingly simple, in general there's no algorithm to determine if such a sequence will grow indefinitely or if at some point it'll reach a cycle or converge to some value.

It's not very complicated to see why this would be the case, as we can easily find `f(n)` and `M` that would simulate another undecidable system, for example a Turing-complete cellular automaton (rule 110).

Let's say we're working in base 10, `M` is set to be 42.1 and `f(n)` turns digits 6, 5, 3, 2 and 1 into 1 and other digits into 0. If we multiply a number consisting only of decimal digits 1 and 0 by 42.1, we get a new number in which each digit is uniquely defined by corresponding digit of the original and the two digits closest to it. Application of `F()` is equivalent to choosing new value for each digit based on its neighbors, and the definition of `f()` above is nothing more than the transition table for rule 110. 

Of course, this isn't a real proof, but I hope this sketch makes it clear where the undecidability comes from.",math

So let’s consider  a provable true statement .

It has a proof , yes .

Are proofs True by themselves ?

assuming yes

Does a provable true statement have infinite number of proofs ?

assuming yes 

if there are infinite number of proofs to a provable true statement would it also mean there infinite numbers of True proofs  ?

Shouldnt this make all  statements‘ nature unknowable / uncertain Irrespective of them being true  or false by proof  ?

[At about 20 minutes into the video](https://youtu.be/HeQX2HjkcNo?t=1200), he is talking about the final step of Godel's proof, in which a self referential statement is either true or false (note that I'm aware that the statement presented in the video is not totally right, in the sense that it shouldn't contain the number g itself; i've read [this](https://www.wired.com/story/how-godels-proof-works/?fbclid=IwAR1XTRBLwCb3cPwfHaulePhymazUewv_wywFig-N93M_MKHNsjrOze2H644) to educate myself better on the subject, but this shouldn't matter for the question I'm about to pose).

4292.0,92.0,How to invert functions that lose information,debugs_with_println,1621873331,"Suppose I have the function $f:\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ defined as  $f(x+y)=z$. This function has no inverse, but there's _some_ notion of ""invertibility"" in the context of information flow. For example, I know that from $z=f(x,y)$ that information flows from $x$ and $y$ to $z$; if I know $x$ and $y$ together then I know $z$. The reason I want to think about inverses is because if I know $x$ and $z$, then I also know $y$ because $y = z - x$, and I could denote this function $g(z,x)=y$. There's of course a symmetrically-defined $x=h(z,y)=z-y$ which indicates that if I know $y$ and $z$, then I also know $x$. I want to look for functions like $f$, $g$, and $h$ in a computer program. 

Problem is, exactly what do I _call_ something like $g$? It's not really an inverse per se... I've taken to calling this kind of function (for the time being) a ""weak"" inverse because you need both the output _and_ some of the inputs to get all the inputs back, whereas a ""strong"" inverse gives you all the inputs from just the outputs. However I don't wanna make up words if well defined concepts already exist. I've tried to look around but I'm not finding what I quite need...

If I considered a function $f^{-1}(z)$ as returning the _preimage_, then $f^{-1}(z)=\{(x,y) | x + y = z\}$. Would my ""weak"" inverses then just be slices of this preimage, say $Y\subset f^{-1}(z)=\{(x,y)\in f^{-1}(z) | \}$? This approach seems to work in the context of defining what $g$ is but I'm not sure how to look for information flow with this definition. If I have a function, be it (weak/strong) inverse or not, then I can instantly say that information flows from the arguments to the output.

I read a bit about [partial inverses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_function#Partial_inverses), and it seems closer to what I need since it still uses functions with inputs and outputs, you just have to consider ""branches"". I could maybe consider $g$ and $h$ as branches where I know $x$ and $y$ respectively, but what they're branches _of_ I have no idea.

I bet I'm not the first person to think of this concept so somewhere out there there's probably a definition that people use but I don't know where to look for it. I was hoping y'all would know more about this.",math

Now that's really cool that it can be used in contexts like that, but it's given me the curious question of...*why*, exactly. Other optimization techniques exist for this type of problem. Wikipedia lists [dynamic programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem#Solving) in it's page on the subject and I can see that integer linear programming would also work.

So generally speaking, I'd like to know if there's either a practical or theoretical reason to choosing MCMC over another optimization technique if one is available.",math

With this app:

* You can see how concepts are related to each other in different areas of math
* You can see how central those concepts are in their associated networks
* You can see the shortest path between any two concepts so that you can see how to proceed from on to other

Hope it will be useful for math lovers!

Could one say the goal of analysis is to find the most general theory of differential equations / integration? What is analysis pointing towards?

For example, if a user enters a number, and if that number is a perfect cube and a Fibonacci number, its specialness score is 2. However, if the inputted number’s only special property is that it is a prime, its specialness score would be 1. If the number possesses 10 qualities from the above list, its score would be 10 since it is extremely special, and so on.

Multiplication is well defined and is associative, and when functions are sufficiently nice enough for Clairaut’s theorem to apply, commutative. When initial conditions are defined, multiplication is invertible and we have a division.

I am learning about Shor's algorithm, a way to find factors of large numbers using a quantum computer. One of the main steps of this algorithm relies of the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) - a quantum version of Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) - and its use in period finding. It seems to go that you take a periodic signal of length M that has period r, and then the QFT will output a function that has period M/r. [Here is an example - The function in the time domain and after the QFT](https://i.stack.imgur.com/bQmyW.png)

Can someone please explain why this happens? I am concentrating in DSP for undergrad, and I understand that any signal in the time domain is periodic with a DFT, due to the fact that it can be viewed as multiplied with an impulse train. However, I don't understand/remember learning why the DFT of a *multiple* periods of a periodic signal results in this period finding. Even further, in Shor's algo, ideally the periods are the only non-zero value. I would really appreciate if someone could give an intuitive approach to why period finding happens. Thanks!",math

It's basically just ""this statement is false."" The proof is a total mess. All the number and symbol converting and arbitrary proof numbers don't lead to anything. There is no reason to believe that every mathematical proof can be written this way.

I also think the Halting problem is bs. ""Whatever output the h machine gives... it turns out to be wrong."" Obviously. That's what the second half of h+ is, it flips the answers. This doesn't prove anything.

4393.0,93.0,"As an engineer/applied-scientist, is learning abstract algebra beneficial?",ahf95,1621787654,"Hello, I’m a PhD student studying Molecular Engineering, and my BS and MS degrees are also in the physical sciences and engineering.  For context, most of my research work involves programming and numerical analysis, mostly for the purpose of performing physics simulations or applying machine learning tools.  Needless to say, my day-to-day work is heavily focused on performing \*applied\* mathematics.

I love math -- it's why I chose this career path, but for a while now, I’ve felt a desire to dive deeper into the rigor of pure math topics that I haven't had an opportunity to learn yet.  However, I've been having some trouble deciding which classes to take (as I choose my final elective classes needed for my degree), as it's hard to tell which ones will most benefit my way of thinking about abstract topics and phenomena.  I've been considering taking classes in abstract algebra, or real analysis, or topology.  In general, I'm a self-study type of person, so I've been trying to learn some of these topics on my own, but I feel that in this specific context my efforts would be much more fruitful with the assistance of a class (for instance, I have been trying to study Abstract Algebra by Dummit and Foote on my own, but I feel like my progress is very slow, and I'm missing the point with respect to many central themes).

So, what are your thoughts?  If you could recommend some pure math classes that would most expand the mind of someone in the mathematical sciences, what would you recommend?  Do I just hold abstract algebra on a pedestal, and would my time be better spent in a different pure-math class?

Any feedback would be much appreciated, and thank you!",math

4401.0,1.0,Gödel's incompleteness theorem: a question about mathematics' uniqueness.,Ga-Aygacs,1621775939,"Hi everybody! I am not a mathematician but I have studied mathematics in college, I am an astronomer so I have taken the basic courses with mathematicians as well as physicists. However, I never pursued high-level courses on math which is one of the things that I regret the most. So, baby steps, but I am trying to learn about stuff I liked, by reading papers, books, and watching videos of people I trust. Ok, that being said, you know I could not catch the incompleteness theorems of Gödel. Fortunately, I think that the last video of veritasium: [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeQX2HjkcNo), make me understand a lot of things. Excited I started looking for something else and I also found a great discussion in this subreddit, a little bit old but one of the beauty of mathematics is that it does not get old, so I learned a lot: [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/el6b2/rmath_can_you_explain_to_me_godels_incompleteness/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).

**TL;DR: Now I think I have an idea of what it means and how it works, but I have a question (may be part of the answer is: ""ok, you don't understand Gödel's idea"" and that would be perfectly fine): formal languages like those used in mathematical theories cannot be both consistent and complete. Therefore, we hope mathematics is, at least, consistent. Ok. And the proof of that lays on the fact that ""for a sufficiently complex theory it is impossible to prove its logical consistency from within the system itself"" (u/NullXorVoid). So the question is: suppose mathematics is not unique (which I believe is expected), can we build an independent theory that formally prove consistency of our mathematics, and at the same time its consistency be proved by our current mathematics? I am not talking if it is so difficult that it is almost impossible to do, just asking if what I am saying is formally wrong.**",math

I want to derive an equation that would let me calculate the probability of a person having a disease, if they had n positive tests. I don't know how. Could anyone help?  
The above equation is derived directly from the Bayes' theorem.  
P(T|K) is the test's sensitivity meaning the ability of correctly identifying ill patients and it is always 1 for my test. 

 P(N|K') is the test's specificity meaning the ability of correctly identifying well patients, for my test it is always 0,998  


I know that in order to calculate P(K|T)2 I need to swap P(K) for P(K|T) 

and for P(K|T)3 I need to swap P(K|T) for P(K|T)2, so there clearly is a sequence, but I just don't know how to write it down.

What I want to do is construct a problem that clearly takes exponential time to solve, but can also clearly be checked in polynomial time. I have omitted trivial details in the interest of brevity.

Say we have a finite discrete n dimensional space, where each position holds a number. Say the length of each dimension is k, so the whole space contains this amount of numbers:

k\^n

At first each cell is initialized to 0. Then, a single cell will be chosen and its value set to 1. For someone searching for the 1, the worst case complexity of finding the 1 would be exponential:

k\^n

You cannot do any better than this since the 0s do not contain any information about the location of the 1.

In this example, verifying the solution would be constant time, which is also polynomial time.",math

4428.0,28.0,Hidden knowledge and peer review 2.0,havanakatanoisi,1621722708,"**Problem**

Wilhelm Klingenberg's ""Lectures on closed geodesics"" can be found in every university's math library. The most important theorem in the book is the following remarkable result, a culmination of decades of work on Morse theory of the loop space by many mathematicians: Every compact Riemannian manifold contains infinitely many prime closed geodesics. 

Except that, unfortunately, there is a mistake in the proof. 44 years after the book's publication this is still an open problem. In fact, it appears to be unknown whether there is more than one closed geodesic on every Riemannian 3-sphere.

The reason I know this is because when I was in grad school I mentioned this book to my adviser and she told me about this. If I tried to look for this information online I wouldn't find it. Since then I encountered a number of published results (including in top math journals) that are known to contain serious gaps to people working in that area. This information is passed from adviser to student and is usually not a common knowledge outside of the small community. There are also difficult papers, that is (peer reviewed and published) proofs that a significant number of experts can not understand, but also can not pinpoint a specific mistake in them. These have ambiguous status as some people would avoid using these results or results building on them and some wouldn't. Other examples of hidden knowledge include (to some extent) experts' opinions on which direction of research is on the way out (most accessible problems are solved and what's open is beyond reach) and which is up and coming. 

In principle, a new Ramanujan can find a computer in a local library, open arxiv.org and get access to the cutting edge math research. In reality, the hidden knowledge keeps many mathematical fields impenetrable to anyone who is not personally acquainted with one of 8 and a half people who have all the rumors. 

**Why does this happen?**

I don't think it's part of an evil plan to prevent anyone without a PhD from Princeton from proving the existence of geodesics. It's just that people naturally  have strong incentives not to share this knowledge widely. Publicly exposing a mistake in someone's work is a big deal and may earn you a lifelong enemy, or embarrass you if the mistake isn't there or is easily fixable. People would share their concern with the author and then hope that the author retracts the paper. Mathematicians are even more reluctant to publicly announce that they don't understand a certain proof. (Unless, of course, they found a different proof. But then it could go in the other direction too; sometimes authors of the new proof would claim that the previous one was too complicated or contained gaps, while a number of experts in the area think that it was perfectly good.) 

We should also keep in mind that it's a good thing that some of the papers mathematicians are publishing are so complicated that very few people can check them, or that some have gaps or mistakes. If it wasn't the case it would mean that we aren't pushing the boundary. We don't want to be [as cautious as Gauss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss#:~:text=Scottish-American%20mathematician%20and%20writer,was%20known%20to%20dislike%20teaching).  

**Solution**

Can a simple tech solution make this hidden knowledge widely available? 

Consider, for example, a Mathoverflow-type website dedicated to discussion of papers by experts in the area, a sort of peer review 2.0. The experts' credentials would be verified, but the actual messages they leave on the website would be anonymous, only briefly describing what kind of expertise they have in a way that doesn't make them easily identifiable. Even short messages like  ""5 people who published at least 3 papers in algebraic geometry think that there is a crucial step missing in the proof of Lemma 5"" or ""7/10 experts in parabolic PDEs could not understand the proof in this paper"" could be very helpful. This seems relatively easy to set up, while researchers, students and aspiring mathematicians would find such a resource immensely useful. 

Could it make things worse? I'm not sure. On the one hand, anyone who taught a calculus class knows that determining whether a mathematical statement is correct using popular vote is a bad idea. Whenever we use a result we should try to make sure we understand the proof. On the other hand, does that mean that only a handful of people are allowed to ever use Poincare conjecture or classification of finite simple groups? At some point we have to rely on the expertise of others.

However, this means, that evaluating a function at a single value doesn't make sense anymore. This I have a hard time grappling with.

Is it possible to find some more well-behaved functions from these sets? My thought was, that there have to be sets that contain exactly one function from each equivalence class. Is there an easy way to characterize such a set?

There is another kind of book which you appreciate after you have learned a bit of tough, rigorous math. I mean after developing a bit of mathematical maturity.

4518.0,18.0,Let's compare math undergrad degrees from around the world.,Skygear55,1621612265,"I'm from Bulgaria and will probably be applying for a math degree very soon. I'm very interested in how those look and how the one I'm thinking of applying to compares to the rest of the world. The program is pretty rigidly structured, though it's much looser in comparison to many others in the country (there's a lot of strictly required courses but you can also do a metric duckton of electives) The requirements are as follows (I may fail to translate some of the courses adequately):  
1st semester:

* Linear algebra
* Analytic geometry
* Calculus 1 (in U.S terms this would probably be Calc 1 and 2 because it's the whole of single var. afaik)
* Introduction to programming 

2nd semester: 

* Higher algebra (I'd assume this is some sort of more introductory abstract algebra)
* Calculus 2 (multi-var calc probably)
* Data structures and programming
* English(A SHAMEFUL DISPLAY)

3rd semester: 

* Number theory
* Mathematical analysis 1 (probs Real analysis)
* Differential equations
* Discrete mathematics

4th semester:

* Mathematical analysis 2 
* Differential geometry
* Numerical methods
* Linear optimization

5th semester: 

* Analytic mechanics (not entirely certain what this entails)
* Complex analysis (feels somewhat late, the physics department in the same university takes it much sooner, though I'd suppose it would be just a wonky applied version)
* Mathematical logic
* PDEs 

6th semester:

* Theory of probability and mathematical statistics
* Topology

I think you have to take some electives in 3rd and 6th semesters. I also think you can take any free choice electives any semester you want (for example, in second year you can take a course on the Riemann zeta function, or anything else you'd fancy cause there's plenty of interesting ones) 

In the fourth year you're supposed to only to electives. In total, you have to take 11 electives:

Choose one of : Continuum mechanics or modern physics(Classical electrodynamics)

Choose one of: Numerical methods for differential equations or non-linear optimization

Choose one of: Measure theory or Distribution theory and Fourier transformations and applications (this one actually starts with the Lebesgue integral too, I believe)

Then you have to take one CS course, 3 pure maths courses, 2 applied maths and 2 seminars.

&amp;#x200B;

How does it compare? It's supposed to be pure maths but there's also a lot of applied stuff. I'm not sure if mechanics should be classified as math or physics.

4536.0,36.0,Optimal Putting for Disc Golf,irchans,1621595605,"The is a sport called [Disc Golf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disc_golf) and math can be used to improve your strategy.  The objective in disc golf is to throw a disc (a [frisbee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frisbee)) and try to get it to land in an elevated basket.  If you miss the basket, then you throw again from the point where the disc came to rest on the ground.  The basket is located in an area called the green.

One place where math can be helpful is at the edge of the green.  At the edge of the green, the disc golfer has to make a decision between ""going for it"" or ""laying it up"".  

Going for it, simply means to try to throw the disc into the basket.  Laying it up means trying to land the disc near the support pole underneath the basket.  If you choose to lay up, then there is around a 99% chance that you will get the disc in the basket on the second try.  

If you go for it, then there is a significant chance that when you miss, the disc will fly or roll a few yards from the basket and the chance of making it on the second try can drop to 80% or less.

&amp;#x200B;

In order to answer this question, I created a simplified model. Assume:

* If I don’t try to put the disc in the basket (lay up), I will land near the basket and get it in the basket on the next throw.
* If I do try to put it in the basket (go for it), I will succeed with probability *p*, where *p* depends only on distance to the basket.
* If I do try to put it in the basket  (go for it) and fail to get it in the basket , the probability that I will succeed on the second try is *q* where *q* is constant which does not depend on distance.
* If I do try to put it in the basket ( (go for it), fail to get it in the basket, and then fail again on my second try, then I will always succeed on the third try.

Using these assumptions, I can compute the average number of throws for each choice.  Let *a* be the average number of throws if I ""go for it"".  With a bit of algebra, I get

a = *p*⋅1+(1−*p*)*q*⋅2+(1−*p*)(1−*q*)⋅3

   = 3 − 2*p*– *q* \+ *pq*.

If I lay it up, it will cost 2 throws.  I should go for it if  2&gt; a.  This occurs when 

p &gt; (1-q)/(2-q).

&amp;#x200B;

In practice, q is usually near 1, so when I play disc golf I use a simplified rule.  ""go for it"" when    

p &gt; 1-q,    or

p + q &gt; 1.

If you are curious, then I put some more details in the links below.

4553.0,53.0,Are you okay with mathematicians leaving important theorems as exercise?,Desvl,1621578660,"I think I cannot give a short answer myself. But let me analyse it a little bit. I'm not talking about Serge Lang who leaves the Riemann Hypothesis as an exercise (if you are interested, turn to the exercise of Chapter 15 of his book Complex Analysis). Also I'm not talking about the five lemma in homological algebra, because I guess 9.99 out of 10 algebra related books leave it as an exercise.

If a theorem is theoretically provable in certain context, and is not heavily related to future topics, I think it's ok to leave it as an exercise, though it may be challenging. But if a lot of core theorems are left as an exercise, I'm afraid something is wrong. It's easier to get lost for a student, as it's much harder to figure out what is important. For example, when I'm reading Fulton's Representation Theory A First Course, I found there may be only two or three propositions/theorems, and more than 10 exercises embedded in the main text, some of which are considered theorems in other books. Indeed this challenging settings may help students become stronger, but to some extent it may prevent students from having a clear view of logical structure of the content, which I think is also important. Also, a well polished proof is also educational since there may be some widely used tricks that will be used in the future. It will not be there if the whole theorem is left as an exercise.",math

The manager forgot to mention there's a special going on and the room is only $25 for the night.  They give the $5 to a bellhop and ask to take the money to the 3 people that rented the room.

On the way to the room the bellhop decides to keep $2 for their own and give each person $1 dollar back since you can't divide $5 by three evenly.

So at this point each person got $1 back which means they only spent $9 each and the bellhop got $2.

I've bumped into a few places where his usage varies considerably from modern usage, and one of them, at least is a fairly well-attested shift: he describes the quaternions as a field (""Körper"") where modern usage would have it as either a skew field (""Schiefkörper"") or a division ring (""Divisionsring""); fortunately, this is consistent with English-language usage of the same time, although it does merit a translator's note for clarity.

But now I've hit another little snag and one I don't have good data on the historical usage of. He writes ""Unter einem Modul verstehen wir ein System von Quaternionen, innerhalb dessen die Operationen der Addition und Subtraktion unbeschränkt ausführbar sind."" (we understand a module to be a system of quaternions  among which addition and subtraction can be freely performed). This isn't what we or current German usage knows as a module/Modul (although it could be conceived of as a specific type of trivial module in modern usage); we'd call it an additive group/additive Gruppe (the term Additivgruppe or Additiongruppe seems like it should make sense, but neither is used). Likewise, he later defines a type of ""Modul"" with multiplication as an ""Integrätsbereich"" (integral domain); this too is a term which has a completely different meaning in modern English or German usage, and it would be called an ideal/Ideal more properly.

Those things I've gleaned from just knowing what the right names for things are, but I've been unsuccessful in finding external information suggesting Hurwitz's usage was reasonably consistent with the terminology of his day. I'd like to be able to say in my notes whether this is a standard but outdated usage or whether it's Hurwitz making up his own terminology; also knowing whether a parallel shift took place in English would help.

4598.0,98.0,Two of these sequences are infinite. Can there be any more?,holdmahdick,1621540755,"Here are the rules to generate the sequence for some positive integer:

* n starts at 1  (p_n refers to the nth prime number)

* If adding p_n to the number results in a composite, add p_n to the number and increment n.

* If adding p_n to the number would result in a prime, and the number is even, divide by 2 and reset n = 1.

* If adding p_n to the number would result in a prime, and the number is odd, the sequence ends.

Examples: 

20, 22, 25, 30, 15. (Can't add p_4=7 to 37 without resulting in a prime, so we half it. Can't add p_1=2 to 15 without resulting in a prime, and can't half it, so sequence ends)

Fun facts:

* a_1 = 4 results in a 91 term sequence which ends at a_91 = 41

* 41 is by far the most common ending value (for a_1 values up to 20M), with around 10% of a_1 values terminating at 41.

* 2 a_1 values cause never-ending sequences:

2, 4, 2, 4, 2, 4,...

I just don't get the point of some of these questions. Some things I learn can be directly applied to real-life situations, such as measurements of angles, ratios, word problems, and simple variables, to just to name a few. 

However, some of them I don't get. 

How is a question such as  4x²z³b²/n²(x³b²z³/(x-4)³-m³z²n³/mn³ supposed to be useful?

I can't do anything with that answer. 

I'm getting frustrated with these questions, but I know I'm learning them because they (obviously)  have some useful purpose later on. I think learning the purpose of these sort of questions will give me more motivation, and not become as frustrated with them.

Lets say you have an object—lets say a gold mine—and the object produces a certain number of resources per week—lets say five gold bars.

To create a gold mine you would need fifteen gold bars to pay for labor, material, and such.

I want to know if you can find a formula, P(w), where when inputting the current week since first week you receive the weekly revenue of all the gold mines in operation.

Assuming you start with one gold mine, are constantly investing into more gold mines as soon as you have the capital, and cannot buy partial gold mines, what would the formula for P(w) be?

Values:
Gold mine - 15 gold bars
Revenue per mine - 5 gold bars
Starting balance - 0 gold bars
Balance after the 1st week - 5 gold bars

If you need clarification, or want further explanation, please let me know.

I am just starting my mathematical journey, please be easy on me :)

I was toying around with the idea of generating elliptic curves from slicing a surface in 3D. Similar to conic sections being generated from slicing a cone with a plane (Slicing `x^2+y^2=z^2`). The closest thing I came up with was `(x+y+z)^3=x^2+y^2-z^2`.

I then tried taking a vertical slice using `z=x+y-1` and I got `(x+y+x+y-1)^3=x^2+y^2+(x+y-1)^2`.

Plotting the 3d implicit equation and the ""slice"" gives me things that look like elliptic curves. Is there any way to check that the equations produced from the vertical ""slices"" are actually an elliptic curves?",math

4656.0,56.0,earth/air/fire/water tetrahedral graph theory,everydayandromeda,1621478808,"Correct me if this makes no sense, but my friend and I came up with a theory a few months ago that music can have any combination of earth, fire, water, and air. Personally, I feel that country/ folk is earth, rock/ rap is fire, chill r&amp;b type music is water, and pop/ electronic is air. Feel free to disagree because that's beside the point. 

Of course, songs can contain multiple elements. I'm a big fan of weyes blood and I think her music is primarily a mixture of air and earth, with perhaps a bit of water and probably not much fire. Therefore, my friend and I wanted to come up with a way to graph the combination of elements in a song. We threw some ideas around but none seemed convincing until today.  

I saw this post on Instagram (https://imgur.com/gallery/s4cWNNs) that got me thinking. If you can measure three qualities using the sides of a triangle, could you measure four qualities using the faces of a tetrahedron? Each face would represent one element, and the position of a point within the tetrahedron would indicate how much of each element a song contains (I thought maybe you could use the distance formula to calculate how much of each element a song contains. E.g. The closer a song is to one of the faces the more of that element it contains). If a song was right in the middle of the ""water"" face it would be 100% water, and if a song was in the middle of the entire tetrahedron, it would contain equal elements. 

Is my theory valid? Keep in mind I have not studied math since high school.",math

I can't find the video but an equivalent is:  

&gt; The point of rationalizing a denominator is to make it easier to understand what the quantity really is by removing radicals from the denominators.

I don't want to fall into the trap of dismissing something because I can't think of how it'd useful today, but a topic based (solely) on making calculations easier when people didn't have calculators doesn't seem to be. I could see a numeracy argument but even that seems iffy from a marginal utility perspective given the rest of a typical math curriculum. 

To be clear, I'm not saying if you can do it on a calculator (or Wolfram Alpha) then it's not needed. A topic like manually calculating Riemann sums would fall under that argument, but it builds an irreplaceable intuition for how integration works.  (Whether or not it needs to be on a test is a different discussion.)

More broadly, thinking about this reminds me of when I taught and students would ask the dreaded question: ""What's the use of this?"" and I didn't have an answer. Some of those situations were down to my own inadequacy, but I don't think they all were.

4728.0,28.0,Social Media in Mathematics and Academics,AcademicOverAnalysis,1621429661,"I was wondering what everyone’s approach to promoting your work or even yourself is on social media. I don’t use Twitter or Facebook much for this purpose, but I do leverage YouTube considerably. I also post on here somewhat regularly.

When I talk to older and more established mathematician, the responses are a bit of a mixed bag. Some are supportive and say that they wish they could do something like what I do, while others are openly disdainful. The latter believe that math should be pursued by its own virtue, and that it is somewhat dirty to try and promote it like this.

Personally, I feel that maintaining a social media account and being transparent about my work, my difficulties, and my successes help with outreach and makes mathematics seem more approachable. Also, while I can give the same talks at an academic conference, that’s weeks of preparation to show to as many as 7 people, whereas my best research videos have hundreds, if not over a thousand views. Finally, I feel that I need to make myself known so that my graduate students will have a better shot at getting a job. If someone knows who I am, and likes my work, they will look at my students’ CVs just a bit longer.

4793.0,93.0,My thoughts on Chapter 2 of John Lee's Introduction to Topological Manifolds,gul_dukat_,1621366723," **Not that anyone asked** \- I just thought I might make a post like this upon completing each of the chapters in this book to give other people an idea of what they're in for if they pick up the book! This is by no means a professional opinion - I just have a math degree and am studying stuff on my own now. In other words, I'm not a professor so some of my opinions may be misguided. If that is the case, forgive me. Either way, I hope this helps someone in the future if they are trying to pick a book to learn from.

&amp;#x200B;

**General Overview:**

Chapter 2 is titled **Topological Spaces**, and serves as a quick summary of basic topological concepts, including open sets, closed sets, the various criteria of the latter two, continuity, homeomorphisms, and notions of separation in topological spaces (such as the Hausdorff property and separability). In addition, the entire chapter is a buildup to the introduction of the idea of a topological manifold.

Lee tells you all you need to know about topology before learning about manifolds. When you get to his definition of a topological manifold at the end of the chapter, every piece of the definition was previously explained earlier in the chapter. Before this definition, there were some things that I'd learn about and wonder what purpose it served in the bigger picture. When I got to the big definition, it all made sense - for me, it was almost like watching the 'big fight' of an action movie (like when the Avengers first teamed up, except less action and more math). You had all these concepts which separately didn't have much relation to each other (as far as I could personally see), then finally they all went together to form the definition of a manifold. I really liked that moment.  

Of the 25 practice problems at the end of the chapter, I did not complete 7 of them - 5 of these, I made an attempt to complete but needed to seek outside help on Reddit (or Google) to complete the proof. The other 2, I skipped because they involved multiple if and only if statements involving set equalities (No hate, that just would have taken a while and is tedious to me). As for the other 18 problems, I was able to complete them using only the resources in the book, and an hour or two of thinking (but a couple of the problems, I had to sleep on and finish the next day).  

In addition, I tried to prove the theorems and propositions before looking at the proof in the book. Usually, I was able to do this, though some of my proofs were much less elegant than the proof presented by Lee. I was able to complete most of the exercises as well. Overall, the chapter is self-contained, but if you need brushing up on set theory, like I did, you will likely have to refer to the appendices a lot.  

&amp;#x200B;

**Cons:**  

For me, one shortcoming of the chapter was that once you get to the definition of a topological manifold, the chapter speeds up immensely. There are less examples and exercises between new definitions after this point. I thought that learning everything between that point and the end of the chapter would take me at least a week, but I was able to finish reading through the chapter at the end of the day. It is very likely that this was intentional (as the entire rest of the book is about topological manifolds), but for me, it was difficult to absorb the new definitions without context behind them, or using them in an exercise or example. I will say that Lee explicitly states that some of the theorems about manifolds cannot be proven until further into the book. I am hesitant to really consider this a con, as I totally understand why he didn't go into great depth about manifolds in this chapter. That said, the practice problems involving manifolds were more difficult than the rest of the practice problems because I had little exposure to manifolds beyond their definitions and a few examples. 

 

**Pros:**  

Going off of the cons, there is really nothing about manifolds with or without boundary that the reader isn't able to understand, it is just a lot thrown at you at once. Everything is still perfectly within the scope of the chapter, though.  

Overall, the chapter is a really good quick-and-dirty review of topology for someone that wants to jump in to learning about topological manifolds. Lee gives many practical examples of what is going on, which, of course, usually involves metric spaces and sets in Rn. I think this is unavoidable if you actually want your readers to get a mental grasp on some of the concepts. I know that many other topology books take this approach as well. I think this chapter is great for someone who knows basic set theory and has taken real analysis. You don't have to remember everything you learned in those classes, but knowing the ideas helps big time, especially for real analysis. But again, if you don't have experience with either, there are quick reviews of set theory and metric spaces in the appendices, so in theory you could read this chapter without having ever taken a set theory or real analysis class, but it would be much more difficult and you would need to repeatedly cross-reference the appendices.  

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR**: Self-contained chapter; problems are a good difficulty, and the 'exposition' is interesting on its own, but is cooler after the notion of a manifold is formalized. The end of the chapter (understandably) throws at lot at you at once, but it's nothing the reader can't handle based on the information already in the chapter or appendices.  I, for one, will be continuing to learn from the book.",math

4813.0,13.0,My friend is in prison and thinks he is a mathematician,SangreRoja,1621349694,"Hi, all.

My friend, who is in prison, has this fixation on math and keeps sending me equations via the prison messaging system asking me to post his stuff on boards like this so experts like you all can check his work and confirm his ""genius"" status. I'm skeptical, and don't have much math knowledge, but figured I'd post what he sent me so I can get more intelligent eyes in front of what he came up with.

Here goes:

""Let me know when it is on a board as to clear up any confusion.  

This is it.  If they want specifics I'll give them this, if anyone even responds: 

 x,x\^2 0,0-&gt;1,1 avg in x for x,x\^2 from 0,0-&gt;1,1  

derivative of x\^2: 2\*(avg x)= ((√(((1/2)\*x)\^2 + ((1/2)\*y)\^2))/x) +  (1/2)x 

solve for avg x -&gt; 0.603 from,0-&gt;1,1  

0.603= avg x   therefore 2\* this is total x(not the derivative 2\*avg but  the total 

1.206 = 2\^((y avg)+1) 

y avg = -0.729  

Note: If (avg x &gt; (where (1-x)=y), use (x - ( (avg x) - x )) or 2x -  (avg x) 

In the case of an underhand circle, that in which avg x IS greater than  the (1-(√2/2))\^2 box in the bottom right hand of the Cartesian graph. 

 in x,(1-√(1-x\^2)) the equation for an underhand circle 

use the chain rule to find, as with the same method of x,x\^2,  

avg x=0.77 approx. 

oops! This is greater than √2/2 therefore 

√2-0.77=0.644  

therefore, avg x = 0.644 

0.644\*2=2\^(avg y + 1) 

1.288 = 2\^(avg y + 1) 

solve for avg y 

avg y = -0.635 

notice this(yeah I've heard about it) 

still working on this part for ALL values and curves(arcs) 

it works for 0,0-&gt;1,1 currently 

(2-((2\*√((avg x)\^2 + (avg y)\^2)))) = curve length  

for 1/4 circumference of a circle = 1.605 

for x, x\^2=1.522 

for x,x\^3=1.58 

for x,x\^4 =1.644  

For the area: (1-avg x)\*avg y = area underneath a curve(thank goodness this was so  easy to derive/calculate)  

any ?'s?  

done with education,pen,pencil, and, that in which was necessary to  produce/derive, a calculator.""",math

It is based on a generalization of the [Heighway Dragon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_curve#Heighway_dragon).

One of the ways to construct a dragon curve is using a [recursive motif](https://i.imgur.com/hq5VeoC.png). Starting with a directed line segment R of length 1, it is replaced by two new directed line segments S and T, with edges RST forming an isoceles triangle with a height of h. The segments S and T are then recursively replaced in the same way as R, producing a (typically fractal) curve after infinitely many generations. [In the sculpture, the parameter h is varied from 0 to 1/2 from top to bottom, repsectively](https://i.imgur.com/rK0Awyo.png). As you can see, h=0 results in a straight line, while [h=1/2 results in the classic dragon curve](https://i.imgur.com/Q68jSaG.png).

Say you're waiting for a bus, the waiting time until the first bus arrives can be modeled using the exponential distribution. If you wait for x units of time then waiting for another y units of time doesn't  make it more likely for the bus to arrive. In other words, you don't get ""closer"" to the arrival time. Yet, irl we're often inclined to think ""I've waited long enough, the bus is more likely to arrive sooner""; does it contradict the memoryless property? is it a cognitive bias?

In simple terms it means that given a plane divided into contiguous regions, these regions can be colored so that no 2 regions with the same color border each other.

The problem when trying to apply this to the real world is that countries aren't contiguous.   
For example:  
The Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, the Atlantic ocean and France all border each other.   
This might sound strange at first unless when you remember that the island of [Sint-Maarten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France%E2%80%93Netherlands_border) exists. This island is partially shared by the Netherlands and France.

I was playing around with hyperbolic functions for complex numbers when I realize you can have sort of ""unit circle"" for trigonometric functions but for complex hyperbolic functions. By unit circle I mean having a simple geometric shape where you can see geometrically where the values for the functions comes from.

It is based on the equations:

cosh(x + iy) = cosh(x)cos(y) + i sinh(x)sin(y)

sinh(x + iy) = sinh(x)cos(y) + i cosh(x)sin(y)

If you keep x constant hyperbolic functions draw a ellipses where parameters are either cosh(x) or sinh(x).

4900.0,0.0,"Are/were there people in your undergrad who didn't actually care about maths? If so, is that kind of disinterest largely unique to maths?",cereal_chick,1621259115,"Inspired by [this comment chain](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/nbmfgy/why_do_people_think_its_weird_a_woman_loves_maths/gyf0bd1/), I'm wondering widespread the phenomenon of maths undergrads mostly not being into maths is, and whether it's a maths problem. To excerpt from my comment:

&gt; Maybe it's because I go to a mid-tier uni (my insecurity compels me to say that I almost went to Imperial, and got an offer from them twice), but almost everyone on my course doesn't give a shit about maths, not in the same way I do. The worst of them seem to resent it despite having elected to study it for a minimum of three years; most seem to have picked it for want of something better to do. A couple are training to be maths teachers, yet have not demonstrated much in the way of passion for the subject they are throwing away the potential employability of a full maths degree to teach. I count myself, my friend who is currently planning to be an analytic number theorist, and another guy I don't know very well because he rubs me up the wrong way, among the people who are genuinely interested in mathematics and actually enjoy it.

&gt; There's something about maths that attracts people who can't be bothered and should really be doing something else. I asked my military history friend whether his coursemates give a fuck about military history, and he said they all did. I know a startling number of people who study film (all queer), and it's hard to imagine a great many of them not actually being into film. I don't know what it is about maths; maybe it's seen as employable or prestigious (in a crude and superficial sense, given societal attitudes towards maths)? I can see how if you didn't really know what to do with yourself and you liked or were just good at maths in school that you might choose it as a degree subject, but then you would chafe at the difference in style, rigour, and wordiness of university mathematics. That last one was cited by someone in the maths groupchat as a reason for now hating maths; they had expected uni maths to be mostly symbolic, as in school.

To which u/PaboBormot replied:

&gt; Ah, no thanks for the TED talk! I did want to hear the story behind it. Tbh what you said about math in particular attracting people who are “meh” about the subject is really quite true. Especially at the undergrad level.

&gt; I thought most undergrad programs would be like that, as in, in any subject. But you presented some compelling counterexamples. Indeed it’s hard to imagine a film major or a philosophy major not interested in the topic.

&gt; I find this is especially a problem in the UK, where people are obligated to choose immediately out of high school, and so they just go for something “employable, prestigious, and that they’re good at”.

I'd be very interested to hear the sub's opinions on this subject. You can always draw a perfect regression line between two data points, but it doesn't mean very much to do so. Are we right? Are we wrong? Please do tell.\* Thank you.

4907.0,7.0,Notion of limit as supremum of poset?,Ualrus,1621256218,"Let me walk you through my thought process.

The idea came from the notation of ∪X = {x | ∃y . x ∊ y ∊ X}, which doesn't have a subindex.

∪\_(i ∊ I) X\_i = ∪ {X\_i | i ∊ I}

So we could do the same for say a sum. Where ΣX outputs the sum of all of its elements. eg: Σ{1,2} = 3.

Σ\_(i ∊ I) x\_i = Σ {x\_i | i ∊ I}

So for the sum it's not any set which works. It needs a condition. In this case, having a + defined for its elements.

(You may want to use multisets here.)

So now what about lim? It also has a subindex.

I thought that you could define the lim of a poset as its supremum. If it has only one, it is well defined. Of course that depends on the order you give to it.

For instance, **R** with its usual order has ∞ as sup. That is, lim **R** = ∞.

This should be equivalent to lim\_(x -&gt; ∞) x. For x ∊ **R**.

And lim **N** = ∞ too, and this should be equivalent to lim\_(n -&gt; ∞) n, for n ∊ **N**.

If we want the lim as x -&gt; a ∊ **R**, we simply change the order.

We may have -∞ ≤ ... ≤ x - k ≤ ... ≤ x - 1 ≤ x, and also ∞ ≤ ... ≤ x + k ≤ ... ≤ x + 1 ≤ x. So you get convergence from both sides.

We may call this poset **R**\_a .

The trick is that one can apply functions to posets, and induce an order on the image of the function. (x ≤ y =&gt; f(x) ≤ f(y).)

This way one could have lim\_(x -&gt; ∞) f(x) = lim f(**R**).

It makes  the notation so much more compact and elegant in my opinion.

We would like:

lim\_(x -&gt; ∞) f(x) = lim {f(x) | x -&gt; ∞},

whatever that last ""x -&gt; ∞"" means.

But here lies the problem. Take f:**N**-&gt;**R** s.t. f(0) = 0 and f(n) = 1/n for n &gt; 0.

Here the limit should be 0. However this notion of supremum doesn't do that. It gives you the whole set, since everyone is ≤ than everyone else.

I believe, maybe not unexpectedly, that some topology is needed. Because we care about a supremum but only locally.

Do you know how to give the proper definition in these terms?",math

4930.0,30.0,Wholesome historical note on operator theory v.s. quantum mechanics by Peter Lax.,Desvl,1621213720,"He wrote in his book *Funtional Analysis (page 414)*:

&gt;Stieltjes introduced the integral named after him in connection with his work on the moment problem.  
&gt;  
&gt;The theory of self-adjoint operator was created by von Neumann to fashion a framework for quantum mechanics. The operators in  Schrödinger's theory that are associated with atoms are partial differential operators whose coefficients are singular at certain points; these singularities correspond to the unbounded growth of the force between two electrons that approach each other. To define such differential operators as self-adjoint ones is not a trivial task. Examples 5 and 6 presented in section 33.4 allow some singularities in the potential q, but the ones occurring in quantum mechanics are more singular still. I recall in the summer of 1951 the excitement and elation of von Neumann when he learned that Kato has proved the self-adjointness of the SchrMinger operator associated with the helium atom.  
&gt;  
&gt;And what do the physicists think of these matters? In the 1960s Friedrichs met Heisenberg, and used the occasion to express to him the deep gratitude of the community of mathematicians for having created quantum mechanics, which gave birth to the beautiful theory of operators in Hilbert space. Heisenberg allowed that this was so; Friedrichs then added that the mathematicians have, in some measure, returned the favor. Heisenberg looked noncommittal, so Friedrichs pointed out that it was a mathematician, von Neumann, who clarified the difference between a self-adjoint operator and one that is merely symmetric. ""What's the difference,"" said Heisenberg.

I think he had already mentioned how beautiful operator theory was when he offered a proof of [Hamburger moment problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburger_moment_problem):

&gt;It took Hamburger 150 pages to prove his theorem. Using the theory of self-adjoint operators, it takes less than a page.

Averaging these sensor measurements produces a roughly accurate result. However because of the aforementioned inverse relationship, this average isn't 100% accurate and I was wondering if anyone knew of an averaging method more suited to this inverse relationship?

So this can be something as easy as looking at a Covid-19 infection graph. When the line goes up, that means cases are up and that's bad. But more than that, a mathematician can understand *how* the cases are changing. Are they accelerating or deaccelerating? The curves in the line show if the rate of infections is going up, or if it's going down.

And then limits can help people understand things like the limits of vaccination rates. Like we're all happy to see more people getting the jab, and the numbers are going up. But eventually it will get harder to vaccinate more people as people refuse to get the vaccine or have difficulty accessing healthcare. So we can expect to run into an asymptote as vaccination rates increase, but never reach higher than 70-80-90% of the population.

These links may seem unrelated at first glance. But if you look closely you can see that both of them advocate for learning discrete math kind of topics first before venturing into more abstract topics like Analysis, Algebra, etc.

I have heard a friend of mine doing math research that first learning combinatorics and competition problem solving will make my perspective toward abstract math more wide and refined. He also said that this previous training/knowledge would make me appreciate topics like Analysis, Abstract Algebra, etc much more, which if I had started at the beginning of my journey would seem rather forced and dry.

I am not trying to say that Analysis type topics are bad. I am more concerned about their positioning in the curriculum. Moreover solving interesting problems can make us more interested in the field.

But two years ago I decided to major in math, but it was simple a means to an ends of becoming an economist one day, but the more I did math the more I enjoyed it and less I care about economics. Especially considering you can’t fudge math as much as you can fudge economics and be constantly wrong guessing about the future. As well, math seems beautiful even if I don’t understand it.

I’ve been going to a community college classes online and took Basic Algebra, Intermediate Algebra, and just completed College Algebra. I passed each class with an A+ and am scheduled to take trigonometry before I begin precalc in the fall and calc 1 for the spring. Currently have a 4.0 GPA.

My dream has always been to become a professor — but I feel old and see community college as the only opportunity to teach people which would be fulfilling too in making an impact to people who don’t have much economically.

I hope to quit my job in the next 18-24 months and do school full time while my wife works which means I may not get a BS in math until 30 and a masters until 31. Considering by that point many people are already into their careers — I have two questions:

— Would that be a bit too late to begin a career change into teaching/mathematics?

— Would doing a PhD in math aid me, or is that too late for it?

Age concerns me as I’m 26 in community college while people at 26 are already 2-4 years working in their field of study.

So my restaurant is really big on making sure dine-in tickets do not go over 5 minutes (time guest places order to when it arrives at the table). Mine currently averages 55% under 5 min. with an average of 170 total orders, with 70 of them being actual dine-in (the rest being take out), and an average time of 4:50 seconds for dine-in orders. I want to make them go down to 3:30 dine-in with at least 80% under 5 min by ringing in fake dine-in orders  and immediately bumping them 0:05 sec later. How many would I have to do to get the time from 4:50 and 55% under 5 min. to 3:30 and at least 80% under 5 min. Is this even possible without having to ring in like 100 tickets though? If not, what’s the best I could do? Is this even mathematically possible?",math

But I have thought of a way to get a 1 to 1 correspondance between the two, and I can't find a way in which it fails.  
So feel free to show me how dumb I am but here's the method that can't escape my mind :

To prove there are just as many real numbers between 0 and 1 as there are integers, you need to be able to label each one of them in a unique and consistent manner that will guarantee no repeats and no gaps of either sets.  
But what if you just... take the decimal part and flip the digits around ?  
So the one to one correnspondance would be :  
1, 0.1 - 2, 0.2 - 3, 0.3 - ... - 10, 0.01 - 11, 0.11 - 12, 0.21 - ... - 100, 0.001 - ...  
As you go on to infinity, it fills in every single point on the line between 0 and 1.

And you might argue that with numbers like pi minus 3 (0.1415...) it will never touch it but actually just approach it.  
Well yes, but it approaches it in a constant manner, digit by digit, to infinity, so when it's eventually done, it will have found a label, with an infinitely long number of digits, of which we'll never know the start, and ending with ...5141.

So I'm sure my method is wrong SOMEWHERE, it HAS to be, but I can't for the life of me find where it fails.",math

The fundamental theorem of calculus demonstrates that if you integrate a derivative, then you get the original function back.

This simple idea tied together with a little Hilbert space and operator theory has become the keystone of my work over the past three or four years. My group and I have published paper after paper making aspects of data science and nonlinear dynamical systems better using the product of these three concepts, which we call occupation kernels.

We have brought in over a million dollars in grant money for our work, all on the back of the FTC and Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces. One YIP, an NSF grant, and an AFOSR grant.

It really blows my mind sometimes. Having a solid understanding of fundamentals can really open up opportunities that others miss. I am just grateful that we had the wherewithal to put these ideas together.

How long would it take for me to finish the book? Also, how long do you generally take to finish a math textbook? 

The way I work through any math book is really slow. I often read a page twice to make sure I understand it. Every time the author shows an example or a proof, I try to sketch it out in pen and paper first before looking at the full example. Then, every few pages or so I review what I've learned in my head, as a way to test myself. And I tend to do all the exercises, due to fear of missing out on any important insights. At this rate, I suspect it would take me months to finish Spivak.

In this subreddit, whenever people ask ""how do I learn x"" people would recommend like 3-5 books, which made me confused since reading that much books must take a really long time, right? Or is it just me and my slow reading habits? If so, could you recommend a faster method which still yields the same level of comprehension?

The reason I'm asking this is because I want to prioritize the understanding and mastery of the ""non-rigorous"" single variable and multivariable calculus first, i.e the computational part, which should be important for the Physics part of my degree, and also the math part to a leser degree (I'm doing a double major in math/phy), and learning those topics would take me a few months.",math

5108.0,8.0,Can linear increases cause diminishing returns?,TwistedBOLT,1620991977,"In business ""diminishing returns"" describe a phenomenon where as you put larger amounts of money/time/effort in to a project you'll eventually reach peak efficiency and after that's been reached the same amount of money/time/effort will progressively produce less and less profit even though the investment in the same.

So here's a small example in form of a simple, made up, video game.

You have weapon that does 100 damage and swigs once in a single second and you can fill it up with magic gems that either boost attack speed or damage of a single hit with the goal of achieving the maximum amount of damage per second.

Red gems give a 100% damage increase. Stacking additively.

So depending on the amount of red gems the weapon will do the following in a single hit:

0|1|2|3|4|...
:--|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|--:
100|200|300|400|500|...

Blue gems give a 100% attack speed increase. Stacking additively.

So depending on the amount of blue gems the weapon will hit the following amount of times in a single second: 

0|1|2|3|4|...
:--|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|--:
1|2|3|4|5|...

The goal is to find what combination of gems will provide the best damage per second for a set amount of seconds and gem slots. Lets ignore edge cases and problems caused by swing/backswing, assuming the weapon waits the amount of time between hits then strikes exactly when it needs to.

First we need to realize that for each new gem of a specific type we add the less we're benefiting OVERALL.

Number of gems of the same colour:|0|1|2|3|5|...
:--|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|--:
Damage per second:|100|200|300|400|500|...
Damage per second increase from previous gem:|/|100|100|100|100|...|
Overall damage per second increase from the last gem added:|/|100%|50%|33%|25%|...

So although the amount of damage we're getting from each of the same coloured gems, the overall damage increase keeps decreasing.

For every 1 gem we invest we might always be getting 100 damage, and never less, but we could be getting more if we mixed it up!

If we have 2 slots and a single second of hitting there are three possible ways to fill up the slots:

Input|Damage per hit|Number of hits|Overall Damage|
:--|:--:|:--:|--:
2 red gems|300 |1|300
2 blue gems|100|3|300
1 red 1 blue gem|200|2|400

So in a game like this, you'd want to diversify between different types of gems to reach optimal amount of damage done every second. Due to both of the gems providing the same amount of damage we'd need to fit half the slots with one colour and half with the other.

Now, the question, would I be justified in saying that stacking a single coloured gem causes diminishing returns when it comes to the damage output? Or is the fact that I'm always getting 100 damage per each invested gem and never less than that enough to dismiss this as being called ""diminishing returns"". And to end it of, if the term ""diminishing returns"" does not apply is there a better term for how linear increases cause progressively diminishing overall increases.

All that language makes sense, but I want to know if anyone here has an easy way of seeing this.

5129.0,29.0,Generating PI from the Fibonacci Sequence / Golden Ratio - thoughts on this approach?,vinnyisme,1620967420,"I have had a lot of fun recently playing around with numbers in excel, especially phi/golden ratio and the Fibonacci sequence. In addition to playing with the geometry of the Fibonacci spiral. I ended up manipulating things in a way to calculate PI using the sequence.

I then came across this website where a similar calculation was done, but a bit differently. This site calls their calc the Pi-Phi Product. The website has a word document explaining the math, and an excel showing the calc. They can be found here: [https://www.goldennumber.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/pi-phi.xls](https://www.goldennumber.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/pi-phi.xls) and [https://www.goldennumber.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/PiPhiProduct.doc](https://www.goldennumber.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/PiPhiProduct.doc)

So I know what I have done isn’t novel by any means, but I felt compelled to make a post to give me a reason to fully write out and explain my version, and hopefully see what people think. I do think my version is a bit simpler and intuitive. Both of these calcs essentially follow the Leibniz formula to calculate pi.

Leibniz formula is basically an alternating sum of fractions, with the denominator of each fraction being each odd number, in increasing order.

https://preview.redd.it/5di2k0xnm0z61.jpg?width=191&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f40cd0372f4795a8a1496572aa35470a2b5229c

The key points from this formula are the alternating plus/minus signs, and odd numbers. So I set out to see if I could use the Fibonacci sequence to give me those same things, and basically use them to plug into this formula.

**ALTERNATING SIGNS** – After playing with the Fibonacci sequence for a while, I was able to find an alternating +1/-1 between each Fibonacci number. I first noticed a +1/-1 when I continued the sequence BACKWARDS/REVERSE instead of forwards. Going forward, each new number is the sum of the prior 2. Going backwards/in reverse, each new number is the delta between the 2 numbers after it. When you do this, you get the following:

… -377, 233, -144, 89, -55, 34, -21, 13, -8, 5, -3, 2, -1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, etc.

Backwards Fibonacci has the alternating +1/-1 I was looking for. But I also found it in the forward sequence as well.

Let’s take adjacent Fibonacci numbers of 8 and 13.

8 squared is 64. Twice of that is 128.

13 squared is 169.

When you look at the visual Fibonacci spiral representation, you see how the squaring from above is representing the area of the square each arc/quarter circle is within. For each new numbers, say 8, the rectangle of all previous areas would be 8x5 = 40. You can also think of it as the sum of squares of all prior numbers in the sequence. So 5x5 + 3x3 + 2x2 + 1x1 + 1x1 = 25 + 9 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 40.

So now I do some math with these numbers. I have done a visual representation of what this is doing as well to help illustrate. We are basically finding the difference in area between the current Fibonacci number (13 in this case) from the area of the prior number squared

169 – 128 – 40 = 1

Now do the same thing for the next 2 numbers in the series, 13 and 21. I also realized you don’t have to double the first number, you can just use

21 squared is 441.

13 squared is 169. (not double this value this time)

21x13 = 273. (this would be 13x8 instead if I doubled the above value like the first example for 8 and 13)

441 – 169 – 273 = -1

When do you do this for all numbers in the sequence, you get an ALTERNATING +1 and -1.

Here is my extremely crude representation of what the above is doing to get the +1/-1, basically a difference in AREAS.

https://preview.redd.it/a1in43ipm0z61.jpg?width=701&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ef17690f7f2fed49c291cf0f0dd558e3c9abbe6b

OK so I have my +1/-1. On to finding ODD numbers.

**ODD NUMBERS** – The simplest way I found to get all the odd numbers, was to sum consecutive numbers in order. For example, if you have 1,2,3,4,5,6, etc., 1+2=3, 2+3=5, 3+4=7, etc. So I had how to get odds, I just needed to find a way to generate the basic 1,2,3,4,5,etc. series from Fibonacci. I didn’t want to simply use that series as a given to start with.

So I needed to find a way to take the Fibonacci sequence and generate a linear progression of numbers. I found this by looking at the math I did from the previous section where I found the alternating +1/-1. Using the first example from above for 8.

8 squared was 64, and 2x that is 128.

8 times the previous Fibonacci number of 5 is 40.

128 – 40 = 88

88 is -1 from the Fibonacci number of 89.

So in a way, we used Fibonacci numbers we currently were at (5 and 8), to get to +1 or -1 from a Fibonacci number that doesn’t exist yet, in this case 89. 89 is FIVE numbers AHEAD.

When you do this for all numbers, we get a linear progression than increases by 1 each time. This reference forward to future Fibonacci numbers SKIPS every other number as well, it only occurs in reference to Fibonacci numbers that are ALSO positive in the backwards sequence I showed earlier. The excel snippet below helps to illustrate this, each color cell matches the same color cell in an increasing distance as you continue.

https://preview.redd.it/seypnylqm0z61.jpg?width=624&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3832c7bc377ab8f560c43201889d27d6cec6e72c

So I now have a linear progression sequence I can make using the Fibonacci sequence. By doing some math to generate a value, I can create each number as a reference to how many Fibonacci numbers forward that value is +1 or -1 from.

Having my 1,2,3,4,5 etc. sequence derived from the Fibonacci sequence itself, I can then use that sequence to give me the ODD numbers.

**PLUGGING INTO LEIBNIZ** – The rest of what I needed to do was just excel. Taking the excel up to around 500 values of the Fibonacci sequence, it resolves on PI.

I’ve included the excel file as it’s much easier to see. See it here: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GlZvMeJA4pOvgZdi73HOgwn3lRTjiSo0/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GlZvMeJA4pOvgZdi73HOgwn3lRTjiSo0/view?usp=sharing)

There are a couple of candidates, like integer factorization, which don't have any known inverting algorithm but don't have a proof saying they don't exist.

The criteria is, it has to be ""easy"" (calculated in polynomial time) to go x-&gt; f(x) for all x, but going from f(x) -&gt; x  with randomly chosen input has to have negligible probability of success. 

I don't see anything like the sum of irrationals on the wiki-page, so it's likely I'm missing something.

**Here's the proposed one-way function:**

Pick two positive integers, **x** and **y**, where y is not a perfect square.

Calculate **ln(x)** to many digits. The string of these digits (without leading zeros) is **A**.

Calculate **sqrt(y)** to the same number of digits. The string of these digits without zeros is **B**.

Let **C = A + B**

Calculating **C** is polynomial in the bits of **A** and **B**, so it's ""easy""

As far as I know, this can't be reverted mathematically, but my math knowledge is limited.

However, **assuming there is some black-box method** that can find **x** and **y** from **C**, for a long enough number of digits, the probability of discovery would be constrained by the probability of compression from Kolmogorov Complexity.

This probability decreases exponentially with the amount of compression from the source **C** to the representation of **x** and **y**, which should define it as ""hard"" making it a one-way function.

**Things I've considered:**

Factorization can't be proven to be one-way by this argument because the factored representation of a number can't be guaranteed to be shorter than the product itself.

On the other hand, in this case two numbers can be expanded to some arbitrary length without repetition such that it's guaranteed that the output is substantially larger than the input.

**The catch in this argument is probably** that the sum of a irrational square root and natural log is not proven to be uniformly distributed (afaik), though I don't know if that can even be proven. Or there's some fancy function that can invert **C**, but since the leading zeros and the decimal point are removed, I think enough information is lost to prevent this.",math

We play a game where p is the probability of winning and 1-p is the probability of losing. We play this game repeatedly. We start at zero points and gain 1 point for a win. We lose 1 point for a loss. If we go below 0 points, the game stops. Otherwise we continue.
Scenario 1: we take p to be 0.5 and wish to ask, what is the probability that the game eventually stops. Of course the probability is 1 as we would expect the number of points to fluctuate pretty randomly as we play more games, at some point reaching below zero, even if the total points gets pretty high.
Scenario 2: p = 0.9 It seems as if the points will go up quickly and after we accumulate, say 100 points, it seems like it would be difficult to get down to below zero. Are we still 100% likely to end the game at some point or is there a chance the game will continue forever?
Other scenarios: we have taken p to be constant but what if p depends on the trial number and instead, the probably is a term in the sequence p_n where n is the number of games played. For example, p_n = 1/(n+2)². Which sequences will result in a 100% chance of the game coming to an end.

We should probably consider convergence as a big part of the argument in this question. I'm interested to see if constant sequences, or any other sequences result in the games never ending.",math

5178.0,78.0,‘Old’ math textbooks,PrincepsMaximus,1620905685,"Hi everyone

I’m a student from Belgium who’ll start a bachelor in mathematics at Ghent University next year. However, I already want to read some math textbooks… that are more than a century old. I mean textbooks from the time when scientists wrote textbooks with their findings instead of a scientific paper (e.g. Laplace, Gauss, Euclid…). First of all: can I learn something from these books? Aren’t they outdated? 

The reason I want to read such textbooks is because I think they’re more accessible than current day scientific papers and it’s interesting to go back in time and see what those mathematicians ‘discovered’. Since I’ll study maths next year, I don’t want to read current day math books, because I’ll see enough of them in the years to come. Lastly, when the books are in other languages, I can keep my knowledge (or extent it further) of that language.

Do you guys have some suggestion of ‘old’ textbooks from which I can learn a lot and which are available for free (archive.org or other sources, please include a link)? I have a profound knowledge of English, Dutch and French, so any textbooks in those languages don’t require a translation. I have a good knowledge of Ancient Greek and Latin, but a translation would be helpful and speed-up my reading (while refreshing my Greek/Latin), so I prefer original with translation (in English, double column style). I will probably understand German textbooks (because Dutch and German are related), but translations (in English) are helpful. Any Italian, Spanish… books I won’t understand 😅!

Thanks in advance and I hope you have some good suggestions. I already have The elements of Euclid and La theorie analytique des probabilités of Laplace. Cheers!",math

Maybe the math gods of reddit have a clever solution. 

I am looking for some way to estimate the amount of overlap between a rectangular prism and a frustum. The rectangular prism is probably always going to be larger than the frustum itself. Basically if the prism overlaps the frustum completely the overlap function should output 1, and if the prism is completely outside the frustum it should output 0. And hopefully if it partially overlaps it outputs a value between 0-1 that is the amount of overlap. It doesn't need to be a perfect estimate I think, but it should get close and should be correct for cases where its completely overlapping or completely separate.

This will be used to voxelize the prism into a frustum aligned 3D texture, where each entry in the 3D texture is a frustum itself.

5204.0,4.0,"PSA: A cheap ""White Board"" alternative.",Trolulz,1620870398,"This is something I found after doing a bit of research online and taking a trip to the hardware store. They sell cheap 10ish dollar white wall panels with a glossy finish that is eerily similar to a whiteboard. If you are young enough to have used those tiny personal whiteboards in elementary or middle school, they roughly resemble that with a thinner backboard. I'd say the one I purchased is probably 50-60% as thick as those personal whiteboards with a slightly less dense backboard. They are light too, I was able to hang a whiteboard that covers my entire bedroom door (I have a small apartment, no where else to put it) with just command strips. Also if you have a saw or something you can cut the panel pretty easily, but YMV and the panel may suffer aesthetically. I trimmed mine with a pocket knife saw and there was minimal tearing of the actual finish. If you are unsure of if you should buy one I recommend going to a hardware store with a marker and paper towels for erasers, finding the panels and just trying one out. As a college student I was pleasantly surprised with mine since I was expecting to have to spend at least $50 to get a half decent and probably pretty small whiteboard. I've linked what I think is the one I bought below, though mine was a smaller size.

- With scaling and rotation permitted : There exists a way to combine each pair of shape to make the third (eg “A and B make C”)
- Mirror symmetry not allowed
- Shapes can intersect or overlap if needed 

Is such a thing possible using group theory, fractals or anything ? Can I get something visually close to this ?

I haven’t really learned the subject and barely made it passed precalc.  I don’t really have that math brain part of brain developed (e.g. if making a cash exchange on a cashier, I will sort of freeze if a customer gives change after I cashed out and entered the amount on the cash register, or if I have to balance out drawers) Sorry if I come off stupid for not understanding simple concepts.  

Anyway, for those unfamiliar with American odds, it is simple.   If odds are “+,” then a wager off $100 will pay off that amount (e.g. +265 odds, wager $100 and win $265 [excluding initial wager, so $350 cash out].  If odds are “-“, pay that amount to win $100 (e.g. -112 odds, win $100. So a wager of $112 will cash out $212 [$112 wager back and $100 for the -odds].  

So here is my question: what is the formula for negative odds American sports betting?  I placed 2 separate wagers of $15.  Both were -odds. One was -112 and the other was -114.  With a $15 wager, the pay out for -112 was $28.20 and the pay out for -114 was $28.50.  Naturally, this leads to me believe that for a negative odds sports bet and a wager of $15, each negative odd is worth 15 cents.  And this doesn’t really make sense to me (114*15 cents=$17.10 and 112*.15 cents=$16.8).  These would come off to pay outs of $31.80 and $32.10.

`vec.x = sin(radians)`

`vec.y = cos(radians)`

After that, I convert it to a unit vector, multiply it by a speed value, and add it to the vector's velocity/position.

It runs the whole summer duration, so I think I could handle the workload more... but I am not sure as to what type of math it is.   As I said before I'm very rusty and the only reason I can handle stats is it is very common sense ( to me ).  Here is the description of the class : 

 

""A quantitative reasoning course for students in the liberal arts and fine arts. It presents techniques that help people solve some of the dilemmas of modern life: - how to make a fair and reasonable ranking or choose a winner from several alternatives,when individuals have different preferences; - how to achieve a fair division of assets (such as an inheritance or seats in the House of Representatives) when exactly proportional ""pieces"" are impossible; - how to use game theory to resolve conflicts between two opposing parties. These methods are applicable to personal decisions as well as civic ones. Mathematicians have shown there is often not a single best answer for such problems. This course shows students the strengths and weaknesses of the various methods we might use to make a decision. History buffs and aspiring politicians will especially appreciate seeing connections with the history of apportionment methods in the US Congress.""

I've done Calculus in high school, but I don't have much experience in formal proofs, aside from learning proof by induction in school. I want to read Spivak calculus to prepare for university math, but I was wondering whether there are any prerequisites I need to know beforehand, such as formal proofs. I've heard great things about Velleman's ""How To Prove It"", for instance. Should I read this book before Spivak? This book is around 400 pages, which obviously would take a significant amount of time to work through, so if this book is needed can I just work through both book simultaneously? I've tried my hand at some of the problems, and while I could solve them, I feel like my solutions are ""sloppy"" and not as formal as other solutions I've seen.

I think I've got the Calculus foundations covered as I've studied it in school and I'm also currently brushing up my skills by watching Professor Leonard and doing some problems.

Additionally, what book would you recommend me reading after I finish Spivak? Spivak, I assume, covers only Single Variable calculus so I presumably would need to follow it up with Multi variable / vector calculus, linear algebra, and differential equations.

Lastly, my university, for some reason, forces us to take a second major. I chose Physics as my second major, since it's the major with the most overlap in classes, plus theoretical physics sounds really interesting. I've heard that the math used in Physics could be computationally intensive, so would Spivak cover the computational parts I need or do I need another source to learn the computational aspects of Calculus?

However, I’m struggling to grasp exactly what ω (elements of state space Ω) are supposed to represent. 

Would it be fair to interpret ω as a random variable (not in a rigorous sense, more of just a randomiser) which is what allows X to move randomly over time? Or is it more accurate to interpret ω as a possible event which randomly occurs, which in turn causes the stochastic process to change its value?

5358.0,58.0,I hate the Monte Hall Problem,matthew0517,1620733754,"I hate it with a burning passion, because it's not an interesting math problem but rather about ambiguous rules. 

For those that don't know, the Monte Hall Problem is a game show problem involving trying to pick a prize from behind 1 of 3 curtains.  The participant first chooses 1 curtain, then gets to rechoose in a second round.  Before this second round, the host will reveal one of the nonprize curtains. The key detail is in how this nonprize curtain is decided.

Is it's decide at random before the game begins, as it is natural to first understand the rules to mean, then there is no advantage to switching. A quick sketch, suppose 3 is the prize and 2 is the reveal: 

1.  If you pick 1 it's obviously better to switch

2.  If you pick 2, you must switch with a 50/50 guess

3.  If you pick 3, it's obviously better to not switch.

So switching doesn't actually improve win chance.  However, the game show adds a rule that the users own door will never be revealed, which is not clear from a single example case or how the rules are often explained.  Then, following the same enumeration:

1.  If you pick 1 it's obviously better to switch

2.  If you pick 2, then 1 is revealed instead, and it's better to switch.

3.  If you pick 3, it's obviously better to not switch.

Now you get the 2/3rds result in favor of switching.  The key isn't some bit of interesting math, but that the rules are rigged in an unexpected way. And maybe this is an interesting lesson, the particulars of how rules and laws are set up often produces exploits that on the surface seen fair but are only useful to cliques of connected and influential individuals, but that interesting lesson is not one about probability.",math

I mean, I am preparing for an entrance exam for an engineering course for college, and advanced math is on the exam. I can understand math when I learn a new concept I can piece the information together and even explain it to a certain degree and I enjoy it as well, but when it comes to application I get stuck on certain problems and when I look up the solution, the method is something I have never been exposed to and something that my brain would've never come up with. Initially I tell myself that ""If I solve enough problems which engage my brain differently I'll be able to figure out such problems eventually."" but  sometimes I feel like I am just not smart, I feel fake because I can't solve them. Are you someone who can just come up with a solution after trying it for sometime? Or, did you spend an enormous amount of time to develop that mathematical approach? 

I mean, what's good my understanding gonna do if I can't apply it, it just discourages me. I just don't feel satisfied sometimes because of inability to come up with a solution by myself.

I have a dice which I expect not to be balanced (each face should have a know probability of happening), I rolled this dice 200 times and the results seems quite near the expected ones but I'd like to know more if possible.

5370.0,70.0,"Given that math is a language to describe concepts, to what extent is the way you think about a particular mathematical concept part of the concept itself?",CallSignNovember,1620718358,"Let me provide a few examples.

- I recall for the longest time that I would imagine even numbers as two columns of blocks that together would form an 'even' tower, and an odd number was the same tower except one of the two columns had one more block than the other column. I don't think much about even/odd numbers these days though, so it hasn't come up in a while.
- I think of arithmetic in a number of ways. One of them is that you have an infinite number line, which you can divide into integers, rationals, or real numbers — whatever set of numbers you're using. Then, every arithmetic operation is just going up and down on this line. Once, I developed a tree structure (had to draw this one out) to describe the relation between 1st order (add, subtract) and 2nd order (multiply, divide) and 3rd order (exponent, logarithm) operations — there's a term that connects these orders, but I forget what it's called.
- One way I sometimes think about numbers is as a matrix multiplication. One row multiplied by one column. The row contains symbols for each place value, and the column contains the place value.
- I won't go into detail, but a lot of ""new math"" is about teaching students ways of thinking about the concepts, giving them a more explicit understanding of the semantics.

Some of these are helpful for problem-solving, and some are helpful for seeing the connection between different concepts of mathematics.

It just occurred to me that when presented with a symbol, you have to know what the author means by that symbol, otherwise you are potentially getting a legitimately different meaning from it. In this case, the ""symbol"" is whatever you are presenting in math, and the meaning is your internal way of thinking about it. 

Granted, math is rigorous topic, so as long as you know the language and can manipulate the symbols, that demonstrates you know everything there is to know about it. Or does it?

Thoughts on the matter? Feel free to share your favorite ways of thinking about certain concepts or problems.",math

For example (I’ll use ε for ‘element of’ and € for ‘subset of’): 

“The outcome lies in A; the event A occurs” maybe written as ω ε Α. Makes sense. 

But also: 

“If A is in F (the event space), then so is A-compliment” is written as: 
“For all A ε F,  A’ ε F” 

—even though A is a subset of F, not an element of F. So instead it should be “For all A € F, A’ € F”.

I’ve always been that typical student who was just good at computations with calculus courses, but understating the theory behind it wasn’t really my strong suit. I knew this would eventually be a problem if I didn’t take myself seriously, so for the past few months I’ve been reading introduction to real analysis by Robert G Bartle, and I can definitely say that I’ve improved a lot compared to when I first got into college. The only problem is that I don’t feel that I’m effectively learning from this text as much as I should be. What I mean for example is that I would read a chapter proving theorems along the way. Sometimes I can on my own, but other times I get frustrated when the solution just seems so ingenious, I’d only be able to solve that by looking at the solution first, then move onto the questions at the end. I would say that I’m only able to solve 60-70% of those questions without looking at the solution, but even those questions I’m able to solve are just “apply the definition and move on”. I keep beating myself up about it since if I’m able to reach the end of the chapter, surely I should be able to solve a good 90% at least, right? I guess I’m too much of a perfectionist who isn’t satisfied unless I can answer everything you throw at me.

It seems to indicate that the definition of ""completeness"" is that it must be able to evaluate self-inconsistent statements, which just makes the theorem a self-fulfilling prophecy.

One of the thoughts I had is that if it's possible to create a formal system that disallowed certain types of recursive statements or paradoxes (such as ""a variable in the language may not be defined by the same instance of itself"") then wouldn't that exclude such obvious inconsistencies from the definition of completeness and allow the system to be both complete and consistent?

If that's not the case, then are there any proofs of the theorem that don't use paradoxes or recursion?

What is the probability that it is red, from your perspective? If that is the only information that you know then of course all you can say is that the probability is 50%.

But then suppose that you also found some very strong evidence to suggest that it was red, but you *also* found equally strong evidence that it was blue. Like maybe you are doing some research and you found some historic document from someone close to that pope which details the pope's love of the color red, but you also found a poem written by the pope praising the color of the sky as being superior to other hues found in nature. If the evidence either way is equally strong then you can still only say that the probability the pope's favorite color is red is 50%.

But there is a quantitative difference between the two situations; in the first situation, if you find some mild evidence that it was red, then the probability of it being red will increase from 50% to some greater number X%. But in the second situation, where you already have some strong evidence to support both options, if you find an extra piece of mild evidence that it was red, then this new piece of evidence will not seem as significant as the evidence you already have, and the probability of it being red will increase from 50% to Y% where Y &lt; X, almost as if the probability is some kind of weighted average of all the evidence you have weighted by how strong the evidence is.

So this shows that the probability of something being true doesn't fully encode everything that we know about whether the thing is true or not; there is also some measure of ""how much the probability will change when we are presented with new evidence,"" or put even more shakily, ""the probability of our probability being right.""

Double 34, add 2 = 70 (7 + 0 = 7)

So what is totally beyond the possibility of being quantified, represented and analyzed in terms of numbers?

Suppose a group of s siblings goes trick-or-treating on a block with h houses. They do so by each simultaneously and independently choosing among the not-yet-visited houses with uniform probability, visiting one house per unit of time. After h units of time, the trick-or-treating is finished. They go home and each eat c candy bars before succumbing to their sugar comas. Their parents eat the remaining stash as a meal of m candy bars.

The catch? It's possible that siblings ""collide"" and visit the same house. Each house offers only one candy bar per unit of time, with the expectation that the siblings will split the bar.

The problem is, given h and c, what value of s maximizes the expected value of m? In other words, how many siblings should the parents send to maximize the average size of the leftovers they get to eat? The amount the siblings eat grows linearly with s, but their hull does not due to collisions. Clearly then, the ideal s lies between 1 and h, since collisions are guaranteed for s&gt;h.

My preliminary attempt was to follow one sibling and find their expected hull by beginning with the h bars they would get with no collisions, then subtracting off fractional bars based on the number of expected collisions. The trouble is that the fraction of a bar they get depends on how many siblings collide at that house. We must consider the ""type"" of collision.

The expected number of collisions of pairs of siblings is related to the well-known problem of counting derangements. But I don't see how to organize the possible collisions in a nice way to include the ""higher-order"" collisions.

I was hoping the problem of counting derangements had a generalization which might lead to a nice formula. Any input would be appreciated.",math

5603.0,3.0,Proposed resolution to the Coastline Paradox,JWson,1620483348,"I'm sure most of you know about the [coastline paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coastline_paradox), so here it is in brief. Practically all of the world's coastlines have a measured fractal dimension between 1 and 2, and therefore have no well-defined length. Measurements of coastline length can vary wildly depending on the base unit of length that was used, and the ""true"" length would theoretically diverge to infinity as the base unit tends to zero.

For a while I've wondered about the following procedure for potentially getting an unambiguous measurement of coastline length:

1. For a particular segment of coastline, empirically measure its fractal dimension *d*.

2. Compute the [Hausdorff measure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausdorff_measure) *h* of the segment, using *d* as its dimension.

3. Finally, take the d^(th) root of the resulting quantity. That is, the coastline length *L* is equal to (h km^(d))^(1/d) = h^(1/d) km.

4. Repeat 1-3 piecewise for the entire coastline.

As a simple example, consider a square with an area of 4 km^(2). Its dimension is 2, so its ""length"" according to the above procedure would be (4 km^(2))^(1/2) = 2 km. There are of course no 2-dimensional coastlines, so something like the Koch snowflake might be a more relevant example. Consider a Koch snowflake with a base length of 1 m. Its fractal dimension is 2 log(2)/log(3) or about 1.26, and its measure is [conjectured to be between 0.52 and 0.58](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amc.2007.01.046), so let's assume h = 0.55. Its ""length"" would then be 0.55^(1/1.26) = 0.622 m.

While this method should yield an unambiguous value for coasline length, it's by no means ideal. The main issue is that (as far as I know) there are currently no good methods for empirically computing the Hausdorff measure of a curve. Even for well-defined fractals like the Koch curve, the paper linked above has confirmed lower and upper bounds of 0.03 and 0.6, which is a very wide range.

The second issue is that the resulting length values may not match our intuitive measurement of coastline length. The above Koch curve estimation is shorter than the base length we started with, while we would expect a segment of coastline to be longer than the as-the-crow-flies distance between its endpoints. There may be a way to reconcile this with e.g. some scale factor, or maybe I interpreted the numbers wrong.

What do you think of this method? Has it been considered before, and do you know of any ways to fix the issues I've outlined?",math

Do professions like this even exist outside academia, and how likely is it for an individual of decent (not astronomical) skill to end up at such a position?

Basically, I want  to know if for a ranked voting system that attributes points linearly, does the slope of a point attribution function affect the outcome? 

More specifically, assume a set X, comprised of N individuals. Each individual x in X is allowed to rate each individual from 1:N (for simplicity, though practically you probably wouldn’t be able to rate yourself in a real life example), where N is the highest rating and 1 is the lowest, and each rating can only be selected once. Assume the rating corresponds to a point value by f(x)=bx-a. Your final rating would be equal to the sum of f(x) for all ratings by all players. My question is, does the selection of the slope b have any affect on the final rating? I can intuit that the selection of the intercept wouldn’t matter as it affects all ratings equally, but I have no intuition about the effect the selection of the slope would have. 

When I asked myself this question, I realized that I did not even know where to begin as far as how to model a problem like this mathematically. I am primarily interested in a proof based solution, but I would also love if anyone has any intuition based approaches.

Additionally, I am curious if there is any way to model the effect that the selection of number of ratings has, I.e. for a rating system where you can select only your top N choices, how can we understand the effect the selection of N has on the outcome, assuming a given point attribution function? This seems like a more involved question than the first, so I’ll just call it a bonus curiosity question :)

5683.0,83.0,The role of maths in physics.,Moukassi_,1620402522,"Hello everyone!

Like the title says, i’d love to start a discussion post on the role of maths in physics. 

Here is some more context:

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a student in my senior year of High school, and I'm writing my maths paper on “The maths behind celestial mechanics” (back when I chose this title, I mostly had planetary/lunar orbits in mind). Now after thinking for a while I’ve decided that the best way to tackle this (as to keep maths the core of the paper) is to work my way up from a definition/a way to describe maths to celestial mechanics and its laws.

&amp;#x200B;

This led me to question what maths is in function/relation to physics (in essence “What is maths to physics and vice versa”, hence the title) and how does this definition (or rather description) give rise to astronomical principles relevant to my paper such as Kepler's laws of planetary motion and Newtons laws of universal gravitation;

&amp;#x200B;

Now at first glance it might seem that this post is more appropriate for r/homeworkhelp or r/mathhelp. But I feel like this post brings forth an interesting topic of discussion even if it did arise from well...  my homework. If any of you guys disagree and feel like this post is best suited elsewhere, Let me know and I’ll (re)move it.

&amp;#x200B;

For the people that might find it useful, this was my “plan” on how to tackle the paper:

what is maths? → maths in physics → astronomy as a part of physics and celestial mechanics as a branch of astronomy → how does this given ""definition"" give rise to the laws behind celestial mechanics?",math

Advice for shifting to a something more of a growth mindset?,infiniteintegrals,1620362816,"For reference, I am a second year Math Major (3rd year in September). This Spring term is my first term of upper-division courses and I thought I was prepared. I've only gotten A's for my lower division (Calculus I-III, Linear Algebra, Differential Equations, Intro to Proof Writing, Mathematical Programming). My goals for the future is to become either a high school math teacher or a college professor.

I am now taking Abstract Algebra (Group Theory) and Probability. For Abstract Algebra I have been doing quite well in, the problem is Probability. It is not even theory-based probability in the sense that we are expected to write proofs, we are learning the basic concepts like conditional probability or Bayes Theorem, and now distributions. I've bombed the first midterm 2 weeks ago (it eventually got curved up to a C-, with the average in the class being a B). There are weekly quizzes and I've done poorly on a couple of them now.

I'm trying not to let that exam get to my head but the thing is that when it comes to the course, I just don't know what I do not know. If that makes any sense. I'm able to follow along with the lectures and the examples, I'm able to do the textbook problems on my own without the need for my notes, I watch other videos on YouTube relating to the content at hand (Like Professor Leonard, 3Blue1Brown, Khan Academy, etc.). However for these exams, I either make mistakes or mainly it's a new problem type I haven't seen (which makes sense to ensure students conceptually understand the material).

I constantly find myself thinking along the lines of ""This is my major."" or ""I shouldn't be doing this badly."" I've spoken with my friends about it and they say that I'm more than fine, it happens to everyone and that I'm just not giving myself enough credit that I deserve, or taking more breaks for myself. I've always been the person to say to people ""You got this, don't let a setback ruin your stride"" or something to support them. Two of my colleagues actually failed courses before (one of them failing multiple), and I've been there to support them, but here I am with one failed exam and now I'm constantly having that ""C-"" in my head. I do not know why I'm so fixated on an issue that pales in comparison to others around me.

I just do not know how to exactly deal with this ""perfectionist""-esque way of thinking. I keep telling myself to keep calm and I'll be fine but again, just that ""C-"" begins racing in my head and I get those thoughts again of ""how did that happen?"" or whatnot.

It could be that I'm just burnt out from school too though. I was wondering on how I might be able to practice a better growth mindset when approaching math.",math

But I need some help with my quaternions breaking down as pitch (theta) approaches +/- 90 degrees. The inertial measurement unit I have has a data processing controller on board that will spit out the quaternions. I'm wondering if it is the unit itself and it's limitations or if this is a quirk of quaternion mathematics.

I've known for a while euler angles break down as the number of solutions from vector 1 to vector 2 increase. But I seem to be having issues with the quaternion in this respect, only along the zed axis as previously stated. The visualization I'm using in python starts behaving like a gimbal lock in eulers angles as I approach the zed axis with theta.

Any help would be great!

The code is a 4 number code where the only option for each spot is the number 1,2,3, or 4.  The numbers can be used multiple times in each code.  After each guess, we get to know how many numbers are in the correct spot and how many numbers are in the code, but out of place.  What would be the best method to solve the code quickly as you gain points for each level you pass and for how quickly you can guess the puzzle?  

Each attempt has 3 rounds where they provide information to help you break the code.  After each guess you get the number that are correct and the number that are in the code but out of place.  After 3 tries, the turn ends and you have to wait to guess again at the same code, but you have the previous knowledge to help you out.

Here is an example:  The code could be 1314, if I guess 1234, it lets me know that 2 numbers are in the correct spot  and 1 number is correct but out of place. Since we have to wait so many minutes for another guess, what would be the most efficient way to make early guesses to narrow down the numbers so we can more quickly crack the code for that level?",math

Technically I can farm and infinite amount of these npc’s since there are 9 of them walking around and they respawn pretty quickly.

So it got me thinking…yeah I got a .036 probability of it dropping with every npc. But how does this probability work when I farm a bunch of these npc’s??? How does it stack…hmm. Let’s say I farm a hundred of these npc’s what is my probability of getting the item I want, at least once?. What is E(x)?—The expected value of npc’s I have to farm, until success occurs. If x is the number of trials.

So I briefly scanned my old probability notes. Was thinking of using infinite geometric series, then Bernoulli and binomial random variables. At a 100 trials I got around 9% idk. But these lead to the probability decreasing as number of trials go up. Logically it seems to me that the more I farm the npc’s the higher is my chance of getting the item. So I haven’t came up with the answer yet, that I’m confident is right. Am I somehow just overthinking this and the solution is something easy like .036*x

b is defined as the half-base , since it removes an annoying 2 that keeps pestering the algebra.  The radius of the circle is unknown and is instead a function of h and b.

Earlier, I asked a question about a spin on squaring the circle using only integer radii and side lengths. Obviously a perfect match is impossible, but a close match is bound to happen with sufficiently large radii. This challenge for me was not about finding the best match, because there is likely infinitely many. Instead, imagine a function whose x value is circle radii, and every time that radii corresponds to a circle with a near square area (with integer sides), the function gets a peak. The size of the peak is how close the match is, with an infinite peak being a perfect match. But not, what if you divide that function by x, the radius, to discourage arbitrarily large and perfect area matches. Well then you will see a peak at an x value of 22, meaning the radius 22 corresponds closely to a square, in this case of side length 39. And you see another peak at x=r=167, corresponding to a side length of 296, but what is the highest peak? Is there a global max past the trivial infinite peak at T(x=0)? So far the peak at x=r=167 is the highest peak I could find.",math

And this is meant to prove that the infinity of real numbers between 0 and 1 is bigger than the infinity of natural numbers.

So I’m wondering, as far as mapping 1:1, why wouldn’t this work?:

1 = 0.1
2 = 0.2
3 = 0.3
...
9 = 0.9
10 = 0.01
11 = 0.11

and the number it told me would be unmapped:

11,112 = 0.21111

I feel pretty confident that no matter what unique decimal you would provide, I would be able to give a unique natural number that corresponds to it.

The paper shows that global hyperbolicity is a consequence of the assumption of the homogeneity of matter. 

The paper is very interesting, it touches on K-Theory, the classification of equivarient abstract bundles, harmonic analysis and has a bunch of interesting new concepts in Lorentzian geometry.

So while it’s technically possible, there’s still a 0 probability of it occurring. But, intuitively speaking, hitting a perfect bullseye twice in a row is even more unlikely.

Then, starting from multiplication of a number by itself we can define the square root, and from there we meet the irrationals. So now we have the entire real line. On the real line we can define calculus, with open sets, continuity etc. These concepts then inspire their generalization to topology. Also, the way addition and multiplication work on the integers inspire the concept of group, and more in general of algebraic structures. Elementary geometry also starts with the basic arithmetic operations, and then abstracts more and more using algebra as well.

So what I am trying to pose as a discussion is if all math follows, directly or indirectly, from the rules of arithmetic and logic. In other words, we use these rules to build a more complex/abstract structure, and then we use the new structures to build even more complex/abstract ones.

I can imagine a system which does not follow the rules of arithmetic. However, I guess (I might be wrong of course) that the systems we can imagine are systems that do or do not have some of the properties of arithmetic. For example, a group law can be commutative or not, but this distinction can be made because we know what commutativity means from arithmetic. It seems to me that we rely on concepts that come from arithmetic and then we try to see what happens if we modify/negate/generalize them, according to the rules of logic.

I hope I explained myself appropriately, otherwise just let me know what is not clear. I am very curious to hear your opinions!",math

I was working on the COLLATZ CONJECTURE. I began by defining five parameters:

1. Even Probability -  It is the ratio of even numbers in the collatz sequence of an integer to the total steps of the collatz sequence.
2. Odd Probability - Same as Even Probability but for odd numbers
3. Step-Integer Ratio - It is the total number of steps in the sequence divided by the integer whose sequence is being considered.
4. Even-Integer Ratio - It is the number of even steps in the sequence divided by the integer whose sequence is being considered.
5. Odd-Integer Ratio - Same as Even-Integer Ratio but for odd numbers.

Eg: Consider 3. The sequence goes 3,10,5,16,8,4,2,1. (We stop once 1 is reached.)

Even Probability = 5/8 = 0.625

Odd Probability = 3/8 = 0.375

Step-Integer Ratio = 8/3 = 2.66666...

Even-Integer Ratio = 5/3 = 1.66666.....

Odd-Integer Ratio = 3/3 = 1.0

&amp;#x200B;

**What I found out was that all numbers until 10000 have a unique sequence, ie, no two integers have the same values for all five of these parameters, EXCEPT 5 AND 15.**

For some reason, they have the same values for all of them, ie, 0.6666..., 0.3333..., 1.2, 0.8, 0.4 respectively.

Is there any link between 5 and 15 other than the fact that 5 is a factor of 15?",math

This function finds when integer radius values make circles with square areas, peaks show close matches, but the catch is it divides by x, the radius, rewarding circles and corresponding squares that are not massive and near perfect matches in area.  I'd love to help clarify any questions on how the function works and what it means intuitively; here is a little more detail. The x value is the radius of the circle. The y value is how close to square the area of that circle would be, but divided by the x value, the radius. That makes it so that numbers like 22 and 167 have higher peaks than some of the more ridiculously large radii you could choose for near perfect area matches. It rewards reasonably small numbers. But that begs the question, with this divide by x constraint, is there a non-trivial global max? And I honestly have no idea, or any idea where to begin.

5886.0,86.0,Would really appreciate some advice,Lostintheworrrrrld,1620172424,"Hi everyone,

This might seem tedious but it's really bothering me so I'd really appreciate some advice.

So I'm 18 and going to university next year. I'm studying accounting and finance, doing placements with a big accounting firm and then working full time after my degree. I'm happy with this, and I know I want to go into this for a career.

&amp;#x200B;

However, I have a deep interest in programming, statistics, math, blockchain etc. I studied maths but business and economics were my other subjects because I was so focused on doing accounting. I regret not studying computer science-I find it so interesting and the knowledge is much more applicable to the real world than 'business' knowledge is. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I now lack a scientific grounding, but I find it really interesting. Are there any ways for me to dig deep into computer science, math etc. without doing a degree in it and still being able to demonstrate my understanding? I feel like these days in STEM the only way to demonstrate understanding is through a top level degree, are there any respected online courses or ways I can demonstrate my understanding?

5889.0,89.0,Finite abelian groups are just movements in a toroidal box.,Electro_blob,1620166099,"I've been really interested in group theory recently, but I've noticed the explanations for concepts rely on a web of obscure terminology. For example, I had to scour Wikipedia to finally figure out that a normal subgroup is just a subgroup where for every element n in the subgroup, x+n-x is also in the subgroup.

As another example, groups are always described as the symmetries of an object, but for me this doesn't help at all. I can't ""see"" a symmetry. I can only see one element, or symmetry, of the object at a time. On the other hand, cyclic groups are easy to imagine, because they are just moving on a big loop, like a clock. On a clock you can add hours, and you can subtract hours. Each hour could be considered as an element. Adding by an element moves you a certain amount around the clock, and adding by its inverse moves you back. In fact, clock math is congruent to Z12. The cycle with 12 elements.

Then I realized, that, in fact, every possible finite abelian group, by the fundamental theorem of abelian groups, is just a combination of cycles. For example, the Klein four-group Z2 x Z2, is just two cycles. Because these cycles share common factors, they can't be represented as a larger cycle. Instead, they can be represented as the movement on a 2x2 grid that wraps around, like a little torus. One cycle in one dimension, one in the second. Similarly Z2 x Z3 can be represented as all the possible ways to move on a 2x3 grid, but because 2 and 3 are coprime, it can also be represented as 6 cycle, so it is still just Z6.

Moving to larger example, you could have a 10 by 7 grid that loops around like an arcade game, and that would be Z70. You could also have a 10 x 10 x 10 grid, which would have to be a box, since all of those share common factors, the last 10 cycle would have to be pushed up into the third dimension. You could go to any dimension. For example, the simplest representation Z2\^4 would be a 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 hyper-cube, and of course the edges wrap around, making it a 4d torus.

Now, my biggest question is, what would non-abelian ""spaces"" look like. What kind of surface do they describe movements of. I've tried understanding this even with the simplest non-abelian group, S3, and so far I've gotten nowhere, but I know it can be done, even if the geometry of this space is abstract, because groups essentially share all the same axioms as a connected space. You can go to anywhere, but you can't ever leave (closure.) You can always stay where you are (identity.) You can always return back where you came from (inverse.) The grouping of movements you take doesn't matter, you'll get to the same place no matter what order you calculate the direction you must head (associativity.)",math

5931.0,31.0,Is there a name for this Desmos.com “playing with the slider” interest I’ve fallen into?,InstantFire,1620135924,"Ok, so long story short, I’m an ex-engineer who is now teaching high school math, and I’ve gained a curiosity with playing around with the graphing tools on Desmos.com. The graphing tools we have now are so superior to the TI-89 I had in high school and I find it fascinating. A lot of this interest has actually been spurred by a student I have who is incredibly mathematically gifted. Since showing him the tool, he has run with it and it has triggered a lot of interesting discussion. 

Is there a particular topic I could research that would explain more what happens when you play with the “slider” function on Desmos? I guess from a basic perspective I would say its just demonstrating function transformations. But it seems like there’s a lot more there. It adds a layer that I didn’t get to explore much when I was in school. It almost adds another dimension— you have the x/y relationship, but another dimension added by manipulating the slider. My study of math stopped at differential equations, and honestly that class was a joke, I didn’t really understand anything and still got an A+.

Could anyone point me in the direction of an area of research, or an interesting website, or something I could work with at my level? 

Forgive me, I feel like I’m asking a question for which I don’t have the vocabulary. But maybe someone can help.   Thanks in advance :)

In particular, there are four lines that are tangent to both ellipses at the same time. Find their slopes and tangency points.

I'm aware of Habert's paper on the subject, but the computation is way too complicated for my tastes. That is, he uses polynomials, and depends on Maples solver to get solutions to bitangents equations. And it just looks like messy analytic geometry.

I'm looking to get a more geometric construction for a project I'm programming. Something like: rotate, translate and scale the two ellipses so that they're in some standard-looking situation (an x-axis aligned ellipse with a circle somewhere around it seems like a reasonable situation), find the lines, then do the basic transforms in reverse.

Inverse trig is allowed. Anything to make this work reasonably well and be easy to explain.

Are there any existing resources for this exact problem? If not, are there good resources for ""nice"" modern geometry constructions for ellipses and their tangents? It doesn't have to be compass and straightedge; I don't think that's possible, actually.

This is a suspiciously integral value, and I wonder: Was such a cross-over point inevitable or necessary given two scales like these?

I played with this a bit and intuited that two linear non-negative scales would never cross over after their zero starting point, if they were, say, 0 - 100 and 0 - 500 scales measuring the same dimension, such that 1 unit of the first scale equaled ten units of the second.

Is having a both negative and positive value range key to the possibility of a cross-over? What other properties are in play? Is there anything about the Celsius and Fahrenheit scales in particular that mandated a cross-over, or an *integer* cross-over? I don't know much about these scales, but it looks like the conversion of -40 degrees in one is landing at ***exactly*** \-40 degrees in the other in every tool and reference I've tried, like WolframAlpha. ([Link to the input there.](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=-40+F+in+C)) There are apparently no fractional digits.

The first attempt is to do stacks of 3, and since 3 does not evenly divide 52, I compromised with filling the first division to 18 and the remaining two to 17.

I was thinking about how the harmonic series is related to sympathetic resonance in instruments, but would I be able to analyze Fourier in such a way that let's me learn more about sympathetic resonance?

Anyways, I've always been strong in math but never really took any college-level courses beyond differential equations and the basic ""discrete math"" topics. Last semester I took a course on theory of computation, which covered computability and complexity theory and was my first contact with the incompleteness theorems and the whole ""foundational crisis"" storyline of mathematics before and after the turn of the 20th century.

Of course that tangential topic was 1000% more interesting to me than the main content of the course, and I almost got a failing grade because I used up all my study time to read *Gödel, Escher, Bach* and *SEP* entries. That exploration alone was enough to trigger a few (not kidding) moments of uncontrollable sobbing the in shower at the incomprehensible beauty of the universe.

Fast forward a semester, and I've been getting quite frustrated at the course of research I'm working on... I can't quite put my finger on it, but something about the typical formalisms used in cryptographic research papers seems really ""kludgy"", like we're using tools in ways that they are not really suited for. After pushing out a couple (mediocre) papers right at the deadlines, I convince my advisor to give me a couple weeks to explore some recent developments toward less kludgy-looking frameworks.

One paper in particular, entitled *Abstract cryptography*, got me thinking about foundational issues--in particular, it felt like the paper had to spend an absurd number of pages to formalize concepts that could be *intuitively* explained in a sentence or two (isomorphisms, yada yada). For whatever reason, the undirected search that I embarked upon after that led me to HoTT, and ... oh boy.

The first section of Chapter 1 in the HoTT book, which discusses the ""mental paradigm shift"" differences between set theory and type theory, finally put to rest this gnawing uneasiness in my gut about what it even means to ""do math"". A whole bevy of confused thoughts all clicked into place in one fell swoop. I don't feel completely insane anymore... yes, yes!

A positive and negative = neutral 
+1-1=0
(+-)=0

Also
0.5+0.5= 1
-0.5+(-0.5)= -1

So

(.5+.5)+(-.5-.5)= 0
Or +1-1=0

Basically I am entertaining the theory there is only 1 perspective which imitates a negative and positive charge. Since it is an imitation/illusion the positive and negative charges would each have a true value of 0.5, and one would have a theoretical value of “negative” 0.5 though not entirely true. 

This allows for mathematical progression- I pretended I was god mathematically complicating myself into the charges. 

Trying to complicate the equation 1=0 so that it can be true. It can never be done/true. But... you can illustrate it with a sort of inverse of 0 (infinity) 

So what I did was square root 1/2 of 1 plus the other half. You get 0.70710678118 plus 0.7071.... and get 1.41421356237. 
This I brand as “the blueprint ratio”

If you subtract it by the golden ratio of 1.61803398874 you get 0.20382042637 which I brand “deviation from 0” or “value of perspective” which caused the imbalance from 0.

If this truly is the most basic unit of the universe, then I decided the next step is making that unit equal 0. 

1/0.2038 would cause a full rotation of the value, like a quantum particle rotation taking a perfect path back to its original position on the graph = 0. But the value would be 4.90627960018 which then must be reflected into the opposite since the particle took a direction, it had to split and reflect that into the negative parallel opposite direction in order to maintain the near balance of 0. Plot this on a graph, you get 4.906 in both directions which full length equal 9.81. This length is a pull to 0 that occurs in every direction as perspective infinitely split into +space and -time and paralleled such that space/time are relative. They are equivalent, yet separate. 

Earths gravity being 9.81 may cause for a perfect quantum connection to the source of perspective and therefore the universe. What if earths gravitational conditions were just right for matter to mathematically restructure and use these “positive and negative charges” to reflect our sentient forms of life which are mathematically complicated through the concept of “time” paralleled to the complexity of space, allowing for phenomenon such as mind paralleled to brain, just as time paralleled to space. There is a half you cannot see but know is there. It’s possible life like us humans are only possible due to the theoretical realm that is tied to the physical, in a way that at first was quantum particle parallels, but now on a much grander scale in atoms, planets, galaxies. The bigger the scale, like the life we live now, the more theoretical/physical manifestations possible. Due to probability, if a planet were to one day acquire a perfect gravitational ratio, it could tap into the “blueprint ratio/golden ratio” and manifest much more complex forms of perspective such as life. Because perspective has split into so many units of space/time, it’s possible for life to experience “individual” perspectives. Theoretically, if said life form were to embody the space/time of the entire universe, it would be able to perceive that relative state of being. Could the relationship between space and time be close enough on earth to warrant a interdimentional connection to source perspective? This would mean perspective is eternal, and life is a restructuring of it. We come from the perspective of nothingness or oneness and know nothing else when we come into this world and so when we leave. The “in between” is merely a quantum pathing you take as a collection of space/time. You could’ve been the perspective of a rock. That likely would have been similar to source perspective of oneness/nothingness. Until the rock mathematically manifests into a brain that can radio in source perspective, the universe is following its mathematical code. Now, that we are human, we can rewrite the code. 

Recently scientists were able to rewrite the dna of a worm to regenerate 2 heads. They did so with electromagnetic charges. This is why I believe our gravity may be perfect for “god” to penetrate the physical. This was his plan- to look back on himself and prove he’s not nothing he’s oneness represented as infinity. 

Don’t mean to get religious- I believe in the science which is why i proposed the science is flawed. Perspective/consciousness is eternal and is the material for everything. The math comes from nothingness/void/black hole manifesting it into the inverse of nothing- trying to rebalance to 0",math

6000.0,0.0,I am trying to explore optimal racing lines from a PDE/Calculus of Variations approach,Salt_Attorney,1620057558,"Hey guys,

so this has been a bit of a side project for a few weeks for me and I am not making much progress so maybe some people here have ideas.

First of all what is a racing line? Say you want to get from point A to point B as fast as possible with a car on a certain track. Then a nontrivial problem is figuring out which ""line"" to drive. Everyone knows the inside of the curve is the shorter path, but sometimes it's better to take the outside of the curve because then you keep more speed for a straight afterwards.

Now what am I trying to research here? I would like to find out things about optimal racing lines, i.e. the racing line which is the fastest.

Now the mathematical setting is off the head obvious. We have a domain Omega, all the points that we can access with our car and we are looking for a twice differentiable (or Lipschitz first derivative) path x: \[0, t\] -&gt; Omega with x(0) = start, x(1) = end.

Then the question is what is the smallest t for which such a path exists? I.e. what is the fastest way I can reach the target.

Hold on though! At the moment my car can travel arbitrarily fast. We have to give our path restrictions! Particularly we model the car with the following restrictions:

The acceleration tangential to velocity must be in \[a\_min, a\_max\], so we can only break and accelerate in the direction our car is facing this quickly.

The acceleration orthogonal to velocity must be in \[-C\_tract, C\_tract\], where C\_tract is a constant that represents the traction of the car. So if you were to turn your steering wheel too much you would slide and that is not allowed.

Then this gives us a space of ""allowed"" paths for our car and we only consider such paths. We call them ""motions"" It's not hard to write down the above in equations.

How do motions look? Well you have a certain maximum tangential acceleration and you can make tighter turns if you slow down. If your speed is zero you can turn instantly.

Now off the head it is not hard to show that an optimal racing line exists because the space of motions should be compact with respect to the supremum metric because of Arzela-Ascoli (the derivatives/osciallation are bounded -&gt; equicontinuity).

But what I am really interested in is that we are minimizing a functional - the time. And traditionally minimizers of functionals solve a PDE, the Euler-Lagrange equations. You can set the derivative of the functional to 0 and then a minimizer should fulfill the equation you get, under reasonable assumptions.

In my case I will not necessarily get a differential equation but I would like to find SOME structure in racing lines.

Now we get to the problems and my approaches.

First of all there is something annoying here. Our space of motions is not really a vector space. At the moment a motion is a function \[0,t\] -&gt; U, so it only runs up to a certain time. But this time is what I am interested in. I cant take a motion which took 2 seconds, and one which took 2.1 seconds and add them together. I have to consider tuples (t, x) where x is the path to even look at the space of motions.One way to circumvent this is to say we always have a path x: \[0,1\] -&gt; U which only represents the line along which the car will travel but you dont care about reparametrization, together with a function v: \[0,1\] -&gt; \[0,infinity) which is the tangential velocity at the point x(t).

So a motion would be a tuple (x,v) where x tells you the which path you travel along and v tells you the velocity at this point. Reparametrization doesnt change anything here.

Then you can nicely have a vector space of motions! You can add a tiny motion to another one to do calculus of variations!

The functional of ""time spent"" is then not just ""uuuh the size of the interval of the domain of x duh"" but instead the integral from 0 to 1 of the inverse of the velocity (and multiplied with |x'| to adjust for how the parametrization of x stretches space).

The problems are that when you want to do calculus of variations and compute the derivative you have to make sure that the varied path is still a motion, so you have to project down to the space of motions or something... anyhow things get ugly. Just not nice.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So I have been following a bit of a different approach,

For get the racing track. Say a state is a tuple (x,v) of a position and a time. You want to find the shortest time to get from state A to state B (where you are allowed to travel in all of R\^d), and you are interested in paths which achieve this optimal time.

This is a bit simpler and might be more elegant. There is also some obvious structure: If I take the optimal route from A to be, then for any two states on my way I must have also taken the optimal route.

Also optimal routes are invariant under translations and rotations.

This is very much a rant... but I have a hypothesis for you!

If I take the optimal route from A to B and then the optimal route from B to C, then I have not necessarily travelled the optimal route from A to C.

Pictures something like this: It takes long to get from A to C or B to C, but A to B is fast (the picture below is in state space)

A

C

B

Now my hypothesis is:

Say we have a path which passes along these states:

A -&gt; B -&gt; C -&gt; D

where it takes a nonzero amount of time to get from B to C!

If your route from A to C is optimal and your route from B to D is optimal, then your route from A to D was optimal.

I could not find an example where my intuitive estimates of optimality of lines would clearly show this to be wrong.",math

What if we only allow countably many possible sequences ε_n? Is it still possible to get the sum to converge after multiplication by ε_n?

Let S be any countable set of {-1, 1}-valued sequences. Does there always exist a sequence a_n of real numbers with |a_n| -&gt; 0, and sum a_n divergent such that for any sequence ε_n in S, sum ε_n a_n fails to converge?",math

6079.0,79.0,"""Unspillable""/""Liquid-holding"" curves",cubelith,1619963864,"Have you ever tried to remove water from a tire? It's next to impossible, because tires curve inwards. So, I'd like to formalize such a concept. Take for example [this U-shape](https://imgur.com/a/9YQstHR) \- it is impossible to remove all the water from it by rotating it slowly, even though it is not a closed curve (note that some water may be removed). In other words, it can always be returned to the original state after any sequence of rotations.

Another interesting example is the ""[contained cup](https://imgur.com/a/yQdm7vT)"" - a very simple shape that can return to the initial state only after some limited rotations, but after it ""spills"", its range increases slightly. When all of the water is removed from the cup, it becomes entirely unspillable (can return to the ""original"" position after any sequence of rotations). If it starts with too much water it becomes unspillable as well.

So, as you can see, there are quite a few variables to consider. A given shape can have different ""returning ranges"" for different amounts and locations of water

First of all, it would be good to have a solid definition, which is easier said than done. Has anyone encountered such a question before? Is this a known problem? If not, does anyone have any ideas how to formally define such curves (in two dimensions or more)? Ultimately it would be great to somehow classify them or provide a simple algorithm for checking the maximum unspillable amount of water for a curve.",math
6080.0,80.0,Do Math Undergrads Need to Focus More On Writing?,Recovering_Redditor,1619963613,"I was a solid math undergrad back around 2010 (also studied philosophy), but instead I went into law and later running a content-heavy website (so I've done lots of writing in my life). 10+ years later I'm working on my math masters purely for fun (I've decided doctoral work isn't for me).

I've had interactions with professors and in my role as a TA that confirm my quality of \*writing\* (not necessarily mathematical thought), is well above that of most other students in my program. (Which again, is not a PhD program, so, take that for what you will.)

I don't think this is a special skill of mine. Besides all the work I've done on writing the last decade, I just have more time than many of the other students. Whatever the recommended time for homework is, I'm sure I spend 3X-4X that time on it and at least half my time is spent writing after I had the necessary insight to solve the problem.

But I'm curious whether this gap is indicative of a problem faced by most math undergrads who go into graduate programs. When you got your PhD or worked with students earning their PhDs, did you feel like there was a writing gap that needed to be bridged?

During the process of trying to create a substitution cipher (ex. Caesar, Atbash, Vigenere), I discovered that I could make a code where two 1/5 choices can create 25 different symbols (ex. A1 = A, A2 = B...A5 = E, B1 = F, B2 = G...E5 = Y). When I found this out, I wanted to create a 5x5 table of the first 25 letters where the outer rows and columns would signify what the A-E and the 1-5 represent in my code. However, when going about organizing the table, I wanted to figure out the most mathematically optimal way to do so in which most (or possibly all) of the letters are next to a letter that it is commonly (preferably most commonly) next to.

Unfortunately, the only step I have been able to successfully complete when trying to achieve this goal (and the only one I know how to achieve) is finding the most frequent bigrams (two-letter pairing inside of a word) in the English language, pasting them into a Google sheet, and organizing them by letter.

With a system defined by F(x,y) = (f(x,y),g(x,y)) and hyperbolicity defined by dF(x,y)=A having two positive eigenvalues lambda_1 and lambda_2 with lambda_1 &gt; 1 and lambda_2 &lt; 1, hyperbolicity is equivalent to Tr(A) &gt; det(A) + 1.

In other words a matrix A with two positive eigenvalues lambda_1,lambda_2 has one greater than 1 and the other less than 1 if and only if Tr(A) &gt; det(A) + 1.

The proof is easy: using

Tr(A) = lambda_1 + lambda_2

det(A) = lambda_1*lambda_2

the condition then is 

lambda_1 + lambda_2 &gt; lambda_1*lambda_2 + 1

and since these are positive, we can divide by lambda_2 and get

lambda_1/lambda_2 + 1 - lambda_1 - 1/lambda_2 &gt; 0

and factoring the left side gives

(lambda_1-1)(1/lambda_2-1) &gt; 0

I'm thinking about this old paper by [Goodey](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF02757273). In it, he considers the Hamiltonicity of cubic polyhedra, all of whose faces are either 4 or 6 sided. I want to know more about this family *P* of polyhedra. In the paper, Goodey states that this is an infinite family, and cites Grünbaum's Convex Polytopes to back that claim up.   
My question is: what is the possible number of 4-sided faces of a polyhedron in *P*, given the number of 6-sided faces?

I might be able to appeal to the Euler Characteristic to answer this. Denote the number of 4-sided faces by F\_4, and the number of 6-sided faces by F\_6. Then the number of vertices is: V = (6F\_6 + 4F\_4)\*(1/3) : the ""1/3"" coming from the fact that these are cubic (i.e., degree 3) polyhedra. The number of edges is (3/2)V : since the degree of each vertex is 3, and each edge connects two vertices. Putting this into the Euler Characteristic formula yields:

V - E + F = (6F\_6 + 4F\_4)\*(1/3) - (6F\_6 + 4F\_4)\*(1/2) + (F\_6 + F\_4) = (1/3)F\_4 = 2

And so, F\_4 = 6. 

Pardon...what? Is this suggesting that for any cubic polyhedron with only 4 and 6-sided faces, the total number of 4-sided faces is always exactly 6, no matter the number of 6 sided faces?

9 . Repeat from 6 until all original buckets are marked. 

10 . Let `S` denote the average bucket size after step 4.  Let `B` denote the average size of blue buckets.  The difference  `(S-B)` approaches `2*gamma-1` , as  n approaches infinity.  gamma is the Euler-Mascheroni constant (conjectured) 


Caveat emptor :  (7a) Due to randomness, penalties may have reduced all your buckets to 1 element. In this case, just place r into your blue.",math

Do you know the Gapcoin project ?   
Originally developed by j0nn9 in 2014.   
It was, at the time, the largest decentralized prime gap search.   


 **Gapcoin (GAP)** \- [https://gapcoin-project.github.io/](https://gapcoin-project.github.io/) or [https://gapcoin.club](https://gapcoin.club/)  


Launched in October 2014, Gapcoin is a largely *ignored* low-cap, with great potential and a sound Bitcoin-like economic model.  


It's a Bitcoin based Altcoin with a genuinely useful mathematical PoW function searching for large Prime Gaps, which it logs and stores in its unique blockchain.  


*""As of December 2017, the largest known merit value and first with merit over 40, as discovered by the* ***Gapcoin network****, is 41.93878373 with the 87-digit prime 2937032340680225901587237661044194634257090755748117620985887982178957288586767* *28143227. The prime gap between it and the next prime is 8350.""*  
Source: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime\_gap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_gap)  


Gapcoin can still be mined in-wallet with CPU and/or GPU, as well as pooled mining.  


Quite simply, the more people that mine, the larger the Prime Gaps that the network will discover. Guinness World Records, *anyone*?  


*""PoW: custom, prime gaps*  
*Block target time 2.5 minutes*  
*Block reward proportional to the current difficulty*  
*Block reward halving every 420000 (about 2 years)*  
*Cap: about 10 - 30 million GAP*  
*Difficulty adjusts every block and increases logarithmically (it will probably take years to get to 50)""*

Dr. Thomas R. Nicely (who also sadly passed away in 2019) was the curator of Gapcoin's prime gap records.

Clearly, Dr. Nicely was an expert in the field of Prime Gaps, who endorsed the projects results via his web page.

I could harp on all day here about the Merits of Gapcoin, both in terms of demonstrating what Bitcoin PoW technology can really achieve, as well as ""sound money"" and economic model principals, but instead I will just leave you a satoshi quote:

Now supported by the community, this project is gaining back some momentum and need for computing power.

In the most generalized sense, the definition of correlation comes from statistics. However, in practice doing data science projects, I've only ever seen the linear Pearson formula, and the implementation for their covariance is from the discrete case. What if I approximated my discrete data with a continuous functions f&amp;g? I noticed that there is no python library that can calculate or approximate the correlation of  arbitrary functions.


Suppose that your two processes are continuous random variables for a fixed interval of time ( f(T), g(T), where T is in [t1,t2]). I can go to the definition of correlation, and see that the most crucial approximation you need is the the expected value. If you have that, then we are done. All of the required computation rely just on finding E(X), which we can use the reimann sums to sample and approximate (or simpson's rule), with finer and finer partitions. There's a lot of libraries in python that do this. We can use this to get better and better approximations for the expected value, standard deviations and correlations, instead of using the discrete formula.


But my real question is: does it matter? In practice, will it aid in better statistical inference at all? Or is using the discrete version of expected value good enough? I'm talking about time series data.",math

,,Alternate construction of second fundamental form,PaboBormot,1619753297,"This is a repost of something I posted in the SQ thread. Still can’t figure this one out...

Let E: W -&gt; R^n be a codimension 1 isometric embedding of a Riemannian manifold W in R^n. Let w be a point in W, whose image in R^n we assume lies at the origin. We identify R^n/T_w W canonically with R.

 Define the projection map p: W -&gt; R by composing E with the canonical projection of R^n onto the quotient. Then it can be shown that dp vanishes at w. 

Now given vector fields X and Y on W, denote by X(p) and Y(p) the Lie derivatives of p with respect to X and Y respectively.

Supposedly there exists a bilinear form B on￼ T_w W such that for all vector fields X, Y, 

B(X(w), Y(w)) = [XY(p)](w)

Apparently it’s existence follows from the vanishing of dp at w, and also this form is exactly the second fundamental form.

,,Functions as Infinite Dimensional Vectors,Vorld,1619752982,"I was reading a Quantum Mechanics Textbook (Principles of Quantum Mechanics by Ramamurthy Shankar) when I found a very interesting perspective. Functions can be seen as infinite dimensional vectors. Basically the x^(th) row in the vector gives the value for f(x).

An application for this perspective is Fourier Transforms. Looking at the generalised dot product for an n-dimensional vector, you can see that the Fourier Transform is nothing but the dot product between a function and some e^(ikx). Essentially, the coefficient gives you the 'component' of the function in that e^(ikx). I genuinely found this a mind-blowing explanation and intuition for the Fourier Transform.

But I am curious about this analogy now. Has anyone else come across this concept of Functions and Infinite Dimensional Vectors? What are some other possible applications of this?

Any suggestions on how many hours to study a day, how many practice problems to do per chapter or overall any proof writing tips and tricks? Thank you!",math

,,Analytic Form of Logarithmic Like Patterns,OneMillionSnakes,1619743764,"So I recently encountered a dara set that goes something like the following:

X    |   Y
0    |   10
3    |   8
6    |   6
12  |   4
24  |   2
48  |   0

(Sorry for the formatting I don't have a desktop right now.)

Basically at 0 it's a value, then there's a logarithmic or power law type pattern until the output hits 0 (you can assume it continues with that pattern).

So what's interesting about this is I couldn't find an analytic (or at least mostly analytic a few decimal approximations maybe) solution. It looks like some constant being subtracted by some logarithm or maybe a decaying exponential. I found a good enough polynomial approximation for the ranges we were using it in, but I remain curious about the form of these sort of data sets. 

You need to do some scaling and shifting to fit whatever the form is. It has a clearly defined x=0 that initally I tried to just shift the x values up by 1, fit to 

[a - m*log_b(k*x)] 

then shift back by substituting in (x-1) for x but I couldn't solve the expression to get an analytic solution and when I toyed around with numpy and scipy to do a regression I couldn't reverse engineer an analytic expression from the result. Obviously a decaying exponential of the form:

[k*e^(-x)]

sort of works if you ignore the last bit of data.

In our case getting an analytic expression wasn't all that important and was probably ill-posed (the data is kind of nonsense as in we don't know what some of the measures represent). 

However, I was really curious to see if I was wrong about being able to express this in a simpler analytic form and fit data of this type. Better yet if a case ever arose in mathematics or nature where this case did apply.",math

,,On being a pig.,Wret313,1619719258,"I was watching the Numberphile video ""the math of being a pig"" [https://www.numberphile.com/videos/the-math-of-being-a-pig](https://www.numberphile.com/videos/the-math-of-being-a-pig). In the video they say computing the expected scores of certain strategies in the dice game pig is very diffult. This is not true! So i wrote a short piece of code to show how you could do it: [https://github.com/staams/greedypig/](https://github.com/staams/greedypig/) that solves the problem in \~0.2 seconds and it also computes the probability of actually getting a score for free!

https://preview.redd.it/ms7tyzx4j5w61.png?width=840&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc2f87419af0d52fff92dbbaa9e2ff0fd8272ff4

The basic idea is as follows. Assume you are playing a strategy where you stop if you get at least n points. Let X(i, j) be the probability that if you have a score of i, that after rolling you obtain a score of j. For example X(2,5) = 1/6 and X(3,10) = 0, since you cannot roll a 7 and when i&gt;=n you have X(i,i) = 1, since you no longer roll. Then let X^((2))(i,j) be the probability that you go from i points to j points in **2** steps. This is equal to

X^((2))(i, j) = X(i, 0)\*X(0, j) + X(i, 1)\*X(1, j) + ... + X(i, n+5)\*X(n+5, j)

This is just the sum of the probabilities of going from i to j, via a, for all a. (You have to go via some a after all.) But if you look carefully it is also the ij-th entry of the matrix (Xij)\^2! You can continue this relation to see that X^((s))(i, j) = (Xij)^(s) for any amount of steps. Since the game always ends after n/2 + 1 steps (the worst case is rolling only 2's). You can now compute X^((n/2 + 1))(0, n), X^((n/2 + 1))(0, n + 1), etc. by simply computing the power of a matrix! (This can still be quite computationally heavy, but for matrices of size \~50 to the power \~25 this really isn't a problem.)",math

My impression is that the history of ZFC is a kind of Shakespearean tempest in a teapot. It seems a kind of metaphysical obsession with applying “truth” and logic in an if-you’re-a-hammer-everything-is-a-nail way got the better of calculating with expressions denoting sets. My point is that it looks quite silly from a historical point of view to suggest that perhaps the cure for Cantor’s mental illness was to imagine the reality of his imagination by applying the inference rules flying the banner of truth in a kind of military conquest of what was initially crazy nonsense.

Why was “curing” Cantorian set theory of its supposed untruth or paradoxical | contradictory aspects considered such a cause for hysterical activity?

I am thinking something more of like ""The set of elements x in the set of all positive real numbers such that x is greater than 0 and less than 1.""

Which one is correct?

Now I wonder: let's suppose I take a course on another subject that involves Probability, how do I deal with the anxiety of using the probability concepts fearing that I'm doing it wrong?  Actually, this applies to any area. When it comes to mathematics, I'm paralyzed by the perfectionism of the proofs. 

I fear even sketching a proof fearing that it's utterly wrong. Despite that, when it comes to coding, I'm not that perfectionist because I know it's an evolving thing. Even if I get it wrong, I can always correct it later or the error will show itself in some moment. This last property isn't present on proofs. If I don't have a teacher by my side, how can I be certain that I'm doing things right? 

I'm asking this because my undergraduate thesis will be on Graph Theory and I need to self study a lot of things, unknown and forgotten, and I can't just assume I'll have a teacher by my side showing me the right way.

I am happy to ask the students to do independent research on the topic, and they are relatively savvy computer programmers so I do not have any issue with them using their calculus skills to set up a problem but then actually solving it, perhaps numerically or symbolically, on a computer.

Ideally the project will be of limited scope in the sense that students will be able to internalize and understand the application quickly, but of sufficient depth to challenge a second year university student in engineering.  By the time they get the project they will be able to differentiate in multiple variables, will be well versed in elementary linear algebra, will know how to integrate but only single variable functions, and have all of the rest of the prerequisite math that engineering students take.

* ""A-level"" journals which sometimes have good but not-really-that-good or particularly novel results
* ""B-level"" journals that sometimes have papers with *fantastic* and creative results

The above is not always the case, but happens consistently enough that the published rankings sometimes don't seem very credible in certain instances. 

Also, though I have a general sense of which journals are good in my own area, I don't know *every* journal, and certainly don't know much outside of my own field, so depite the unreliability of the rankings I sometimes (guiltily) find myself checking lists like  Scimago or the [Australian Math Society rankings](https://www.austms.org.au/Rankings/AustMS_final_ranked.html).

 I'm curious -- how does the rest of /r/math feel about the rankings?  Do you feel like they accurately represent your field?

,,All almost perfectly nice prime numbers (out of the first billion primes),FlorianiusDerResche,1619606042,"So, first of all, what even is a perfectly nice number?

Sadly, there can't be a perfectly nice prime number, because it will always be divisible by 3. The sum of the digits of 69 and 420 are both divisible by 3, thus if there is a number only containing these patterns, it will always be divisible by 3.

So that's why I searched for *almost* perfectly nice prime numbers, allowing exactly one digit to not follow the given pattern. And out of the first billion, there were a few that matched these specifications. My personal favorite:

After working through a few example problems, I have to confess that I still don't understand its importance, from a ""worldly wisdom"" perspective. The only two takeaways for me are:

Right now I’m a senior in high school who is getting ready to enter college in a few months. I am planning on being a math major since it has something that I used to believe I was good at until I started doing math contests. I know that people have said that these aren’t the best indicator of your mathematical potential, but I’m still worried since I haven’t ever done well in them. I have taken the AMC 3 times and haven’t been able to qualify for AIME even once. I have spent many hours practicing problems and trying to get better, but my scores on these contests still aren’t the best. 

This has crushed my self-esteem in math because I had though I was really good at it. There have been many times in my classes where I could relate concepts to each other and figure out parts of calculus by thinking about the problem. I even spend a lot of my free time trying to learn more math and practice it so I don’t think my lack of success is due to a lack of effort.

Do I have a chance at becoming a good mathematician and getting into a top PhD program?  Math is my passion and I have spent so much time studying new concepts, but it feels like I just don’t have a high enough aptitude to be ever be successful in it.",math

,,Question About Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem,alg0m1das,1619556545,"I've been reading about complex systems theory, and in most of the books I've read that try to provide a non-technical overview of the field Gödel and Turing are mentioned. The simplified, non-technical explanation of Gödel's theorem (I may be missing a lot here) that I've gleaned from these books - and this is surely a pretty ridiculous over-simplification - is that Gödel basically found a way to formalize the following self-referential proposition: ""This proposition is unprovable.""  Given that this is kind of like Russel's ""This statement is false"" paradox, there's no way to determine the truth value of the proposition within the formal logical system, and so therefore that system is incomplete. 

I'm an undergraduate studying computer science, so I only have a very limited math background (nothing beyond discrete math). But in thinking about Gödel's theorem, well, . . . I don't really get why it was so earth-shattering. I figure maybe my understanding of the theorem is too simple to fully grasp its implications? 

I guess my thinking is this: isn't it possible that in a given logical system, Gödel's unprovable statement is the ONLY unprovable statement? Why does it matter so much? If it's the only unprovable statement, doesn't it seem like you could just ignore that one proposition in a logical system that could express a theoretically infinite (or at least very large) number of propositions? And just say something like ""well, this system is complete except for this one dumb little statement Kurt came up with?"" Or does the existence of the ""This proposition is unprovable"" possibly or necessarily imply that there is/might be other, more significant ways that any given logical system is incomplete? Or is my simplistic understanding of the incompleteness theorem so impoverished, unsophisticated, and generally off-base that I'm just not getting what Gödel proved and why it's important at all?",math

However there is a philosophy known as constructivism that would possibly make a lot of fields incorrect, I guess if constructivists had their way many of these fields should no longer be pursued (or something).

The issue is to determine what does left and right for the tool mean to the robot. What I want to end up with is a line that I can use to calculate the next position for the robot to move to, and then that would solve my ""left and right"" according to the tool.

The end effector is given by X, Y, Z coordinates. It is then also given a vector Rx, Ry, Rz (in radians) that tells it what direction to point the tool. The tool itself rotates, and I can read the rotation of the tool (just an angle between 0 and 2pi) but only ""locally"" meaning it doesn't entail where it is in the room, only how its rotated compared to the arm it's connected to.

,,In memory of a brilliant math teacher,CataclysmicFaeriable,1619534498," 

Hello, everyone. I found out last night that my high school math teacher, whom I had for Pre-Calculus and AP Calculus BC, was killed yesterday in a tragic accident. I won’t go into too many details to preserve his privacy, but I would like to share what he meant to me and my math journey.

As a child, I was ‘bad at math.’ I’m not sure where that began, but by the time I was in middle school, being bad at math was part of my identity. I was the butt of many jokes because I couldn’t add fractions or draw a graph. I hated math with a passion and often didn’t do my homework out of spite. I passed, but only because I was desperate to be done with math as soon as possible.

My high school required Pre-Calculus for graduation, so I stumbled in there in 11th grade with the expectation that it would be painful, but my last mathematical punishment. This particular math teacher taught my class the second semester. He brought a new approach, focused not on lecture and formula memorization but on derivations, proofs, and problem solving. He talked about ‘intuition,’ which I had never thought would apply to math.

Something about his manner and style made me care. I liked him as a person, so I wanted him to see me try. I stayed after class one day to ask about a problem I’d gotten wrong on a problem set, and we ended up filling the wall-to-wall whiteboards for 3 hours after the school day ended. We drifted from limits to derivatives to Newton’s laws and the origins of calculus, and somehow, *I followed along.* For the first time in my life, I saw math and was *excited.*

Staying after class, or through the lunch hour, or arriving early in the morning became routine for me. I loved it. My grades shot from passing marks to consistent As. I looked forward to Pre-Calc all day. By the end of that single semester, I went from not understanding the unit circle to being confident doing derivatives. When I found out that this teacher was teaching AP Calc BC the next year, I rearranged my entire class schedule away from the humanities towards STEM classes. My education finally excited me.

He wrote my recommendation letter when I applied to college, and I got into a great school where I’m now pursuing a physics and economics double-major with plans to go for a PhD. in physics after I graduate. Without him, I never would have found the fields that I love and I never would have stopped doubting my intelligence. He believed in and supported me when I didn’t think I deserved it, and altered the course of my education and career for the better. I couldn’t be more grateful.

Thank you for reading such a long post. I want to celebrate a fantastic teacher who died far too soon. To all math teachers dedicated to their students: you are invaluable and can truly change lives. I regret not being able to tell my math teacher how much I appreciate his work. He taught me so much about math and beyond, and I don’t know how to honour him properly.",math

,,A bad generalization of the exponential map,vilimus-,1619529511,"We can define the exponential map on the ring of real matrices M(n, R) by its power series:

exp[A] = sum A^k / k!

But I wanted to take a different approach. Instead of letting the n-th term in the power series expansion be A^k/k!, I considered the n-th term to be L^(k), where (k) denotes the k-th iteration of a linear map. I will call this operator Bexp, short for ""bad exponential"".

This is a generalization of the matrix case because for any linear transformation L on R^n we have its matrix representation L(x)=Ax, so that L^(k)(x) = A^k*x.

This switch from matrix multiplication to composition of linear operators lets us construct the bad-exponential map on arbitrary vector spaces over R. For example, consider the space of smooth functions on R, and let D be the derivative operator. What is its exponential? It is simply the sum of D^(k) / k!, where D^(k) is the k-th derivative.

Take f(x)=x^2, an element of the aforementioned space. We have D = 2x, D^2 = 2, and D^n = 0 for all n&gt;2. The exponential is then

Bexp[x^2] = x^2 + 2x + 1

Weird! If we apply the definition to the exponential function itself, we get

Bexp[e^x] = (sum e^x / k!) = e^(x+1)

Weird again! Can anyone else come up with examples of the bad exponential?",math

Which obviously means the answer is 1. However, there has been so many contrary opinions and people debunking it with different programs that I've started to doubt myself. The only way I can imagine this happening is if ÷ is somehow different to just : (other than the way they look, of course), and the first one can't be freely changed into a fraction.

And not just as an exact science.
while in this period of time the mathematical world of the early 20th century was largely dominated by the ideas of the formalism of David Hilbert.  There was a general feeling that the mathematical formula of everything would be soon revealed.

In 1936 Nazi student murdered the founder of the Vienne circle, Moritz Schlick, the man who influence godel’s in the first place with the ideas of logical philosophical.
following the murder, Kurt had a nervous breakdown And spent most of that year in a mental institution.
In 1939 he was mistakenly identified on the street as a Jew and got beating hardly, and hospitalized.
1940 - Godel’s escaped from conscription into the German army, and immigrates with his wife Adele to the United States.
In the same year Adolf Hitler travels to Paris, and takes a selfie in the Eiffel Tower.

(Frank Zappa)

the rest of his new life he worked at the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study.
There he met another famous scientist who fled Nazism, Albert Einstein That we'll be soon
Become his best friend, and one of the almost only people godel’s talked.
Albert Einstein appreciated and admired the work of Godel’s,  And even noted that his own work at Princeton is stuck and bored him.
And the best reason for his working day’s at the late time’s of his life.  is the walk and conversation with Godel’s in the park of the university.
In order to obtain American citizenship godel’s applied to study the system of government and the constitution.
Accompanied by Albert Einstein and Oscar Morgenstern (fathers of game theory) as witnesses (another short story waiting to be written). The trio entered the judge who noted that Gedal's previous citizenship ""was under a bad dictatorship ... but fortunately this is not possible in America.""  ״on the contrary I know how this can happen” say Kurt.
Einstein hold one's breath, but the judge did not Really understood Godel’s. And interrupted his words with congratulations on the new American citizenship.  Before Godel’s can explained the judge how a dictator could take over America.

as per the title, I don't necessarily enjoy proofs. A little bit of context, I re-enrolled in school in fall 2018, going from an algebra review class, and have worked all my way to where I am now (senior at university). I am expected to graduate June 2022 with a degree in math. 

Unfortunately, upper division math is a total shock and hard adjustment. I truly adored the computation of math, as it was so satisfying. I also really enjoyed the classroom environment, and had goals to go into grad school to study math. Unfortunately, I don't think this is the case anymore, as these proof upper division classes just are not my interest, I really enjoyed the computational, applied stuff. While I would truly enjoy teaching algebra/calc/diffeq (and tutoring has been a wonderful job), I am just not sure if I have it in me to pursue more pure math/proofs to understand why math works (or research).

For reference, the Upper Division math classes I have taken is an intro to proofs (analysis and group theory), number theory, mathematical analysis 1 and 2, and discrete math. I have also staten calculus based stats, and will be taking group theory this summer. The next fall/winter term will be two mathematical stats classes, and two numerical calculus classes.

I wish that when I had re-enrolled, that I would have taken an engineering class to get a taste of that side. Despite this, I am just so close to graduating that I am not going to call it quits. I am going to earn my bachelors degree. 

Anyways, my school has a bridge program, for where graduates can apply to be in the electrical engineering masters program (granted they take remedial classes). I've read and heard that EE is very applied math. **Should I sign up for the bridge program into a masters for EE? Should I expect EE to be pretty computationally heavy mathematics (along with circuits, electronics, magnetism etc). I would obviously take the required remedial classes I never took.**",math

,,"Having trouble following this proof _about_ Q arithmetic, in Peter Smith's _An Introduction to Goedel's Theorems_",Porn_Steal,1619469748,"Edit: I come to a realization towards the end of this post but I still am a little confused and still have a question.

\------

He's proving Q is not complete. (Specifically, that it's negation-incomplete.) I'll quote the relevant passages that I'm having a hard time with. I understand the strategy of finding an interpretation that makes all the axioms true but a certain wff false, in order to show that the wff is not a theorem of Q arithmetic. What I'm having trouble with is something specific he does while carrying out that strategy.

First, a one sentence quotation from just before he goes into this, which I willl return to at the end to explain my trouble: ""Q can prove any particular wff of the form 0 + n = n"" (note, he has a line over both n's in that sentence). 

I'll return to that at the end.

Next he outlines his proof strategy:

""We use an elementary 'model-theoretic' argument. To show a wff Chi is not a theorem of a given theory T, it is enough to find a model or interpretation... for the T-wffs which makes the axioms of T true and hence makes all its theorems true, but which makes Chi false.""

So far so good. (BTW it's understood in this passage that Q arithmetic is consistent, hence that if its axioms are true all its theorems are true.)

Chi in this case is going to be the wff for-all-x(0 + x = x).

His task is to find an interpretation of Q which makes Q's axioms true, but makes Chi false. From that we can conclude Chi isn't a theorem of Q. Moreover not-Chi is also not a theorem of Q, as shown by its falseness on the standard interpretation of Q. Therefore Q doesn't decide Chi, and so Q is negation-incomplete. So far so good.

To carry this proof out he describes an interpretation with a domain consisting not only of the natural numbers but also of two elements a and b. They can be literally anything you like other than a natural number.

'S' is re-interpreted to mean the relation S\*, such that S\*a = a and S\*b = b (S\*n for any natural number n is the same as what we normally mean by Sn i.e. the successor relation). 

Meanwhile, on this new interpretation, + picks out a relation +\*, just like normal + for natural numbers, but when it comes to a and b, a +\* n = b, and b +\* n = a.

Okay, again, so far so good. 

Here's the part I have trouble with. After setting forth the above, and noting that it makes the first 5 axioms of Q-arithmetic true, he states ""But by construction, 0 +\* a =/= a, so this interpretation makes Chi false."" (as noted above Chi =def 'for-all-x(0 + x = x)'

I understand how it makes Chi false.

What I'm having trouble with is, when I try to understand this \_together\_ with the initial quotation above: Q can prove any particular wff of the form 0 + n = n (with lines over the n's).

If that's so, then can't Q prove 0 + a = a \[RECORD SCRATCH\]

As I've put this post together I've \_just realized\_ no, Q can't prove 0 + a = a because that's not even a wff of Q. So my question is a little different from what I thought it was going to be.

I think I get it slightly better than I did when I started this post but, to verify: On this deviant (his word) interpretation are a and b, even though they are elements in the domain, actually \_not referenceable\_ in the language of Q? In the sense that, for any wff m + n = p, on this deviant interpretation, m n and p will always refer to a natural number, and never to a or b?",math

,,Why are the Mandelbrot iteration functions so unique?,jasonrohrer,1619468976,"Working through orbit traces really helps to understand why the Mandelbrot set exhibits the complexity that it does.  This video is a great example of that:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFftmWSzgmk

You can see, for example, that some points have beautiful spiral-in orbits, while others have spiral-out orbits, or chaotic orbits.

If we convert out of complex space and just use two dimensional real coordinates X and Y, we still get pretty simple iteration functions:

xB = xA * xA  - yA * yA + x0
yB = 2 * xA * yA + y0

Looking at it this way helps to see exactly what's going on with X and Y as we jump around the Cartesian plane.  For example, if both x0 and y0 are positive, but y0 &gt; x0, x will jump negative after one iteration, but y will stay positive.

So you might think that any old (x,y) iteration function would produce similarly complex results, but when you go to tweak the structure of these functions, you quickly find that this is not the case at all.  Most tweaks either collapse into sets that aren't very interesting, or produce warped/twisted/squished Mandelbrot sets.

And the tweaks that do produce complex, Mandelbrot-ish results are quite limited indeed.  Of course, we have the cubic Mandelbrot extension:

xB = xA * xA * xA - 3 * xA * yA * yA + x0;
yB = 3 * xA * xA * yA - yA * yA * yA + y0;

And we can keep going up to higher powers, and each of these produces complex results.  But little tweaks to these functions causes the sets to collapse out of complexity too.

Burning Ship is an example of a small tweak that produces ""different looking"" complexity, but the result is not nearly as beautiful:

xB = xA * xA  - yA * yA + x0
yB = abs( 2 * xA * yA ) + y0

Tricorn is another small tweak that results in ""squished"" Mandelbrot shapes:

xB = xA * xA  - yA * yA + x0
yB = -2 * xA * yA + y0

And if you get any wilder with your tweaking than this, you get ""nothing interesting"" pretty much universally.

So it seems like there's a very delicate balance here, where that first set of equations is just perfect to produce these spiral-in vs spiral-out orbits.  And that makes it feel like a very special discovery indeed.

But is it?

Naively, you might think that there's a whole world full of different, beautiful fractal shapes that are possible using different plane iteration functions and escape time detection.  That there would be whole families and sub-families.  But that doesn't seem to be the case.

Which makes the Mandelbrot set a very special discovery indeed.

What bugs me is the insistence on reusing y as a name for the outer function since y has already been defined and just makes it annoying to read the examples and the rule. I understand that once you get used to the rule (which I am now) you no longer have to think about it and also, using Leibniz notation  over Lagrange notation for derivatives would make things more clear.

Coming from programming and Haskell when I first started reading this chapter I thought of function composition, i.e f (g x) = (f ∙ g) x

I've never achieved a good or even passable grade in mathematics or physics whilst in school, and I hated it with a passion. I never got to learn anything above rule of three level and I refused to study or even do any homework. I think I entered university out of pure luck...

I majored in letters – linguistics, literature, art, etc. –, quite the opposite of numbers, right? I'm really into classics, I teach and translate ancient greek, and bought a copy of Euclid's Elements in 2020. 

I started studying it a few months ago and I love it so so so much! I wish I was taught math with this lovely book. Since then I've read a book on the history of mathematics and bought Thomas Heath's books on greek mathematics. I have the Green Lion Press edition of the Elements and also Taschen's Oliver Byrne edition, which is absolutely beautiful and mesmerising. Now I'm able to write down my own proofs after constructing whatever the book says I need to construct! I never thought I'd make sense of the kind of things I'm dealing with right now. 

Can anyone explain to me why we never read any of the ""original"" works on math in school? I have an idea due to my own experience with education, but I really want to know this from real mathematicians, people who work with the subject.
Also, what do you guys think I should study after finishing the Elements? 

I wish I was taught this stuff when I was younger, I'm learning now at 25 to think mathematically. I had a hard time in logic classes when I used to hang around the philosophy department in university... I feel like I would just burn through those assignments nowadays haha

Anyhow, I just wanted to share my experience... Thanks for reading and have a great day!",math
,,"With known inputs/outputs and enough sample data, is it possible to deduce an unknown formula?",btonasse,1619419027,"Dear friends,  


I'm not a mathematician by any stretch, but I'm curious enough to think about certain problems from time to time. Given known inputs (x and y) and output (z) and virtually unlimited sample data, is it possible to deduce/approximate a completely unknown formula? If the relationship between inputs and outputs is linear (we don't know this beforehand), I guess we can use a linear regression technique for an approximation, but what if it's not?

,,Genius meets Lunatic: 1994 discussion between Terry Tao and Ludwig Plutonium,ScottContini,1619416038,"I was finally able to dig up an old sci.math Usenix group discussion between one of the world's greatest mathematicians (Terry Tao -- though this was way before he won his field medal) and one of the Internet's greatest lunatics ([Ludwig Plutonium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet_personality#Eccentric_believers), who has changed his name several times over the years), so I'd thought I'd share it here and ask if people have other great examples of discussions like this.

I think this is a great example of how many great mathematicians are open to communicating with just about anybody.  I have other examples like this, but this one is by far my favourite.  Of course there is the case of when Hardy opened his mind to considering Ramanujan -- before Ramanujan was known to the world, and Hardy had no reason to believe he was anything serious until he tried out a few of the formulas that were posted to him.  So that's another example, but let's get back to Tao and Plutonium.

Here's the good stuff:

- Plutonium claims to have [two proofs of the Riemann Hypothesis](https://groups.google.com/g/sci.math/c/2m-jqsZYZW8/m/ExLjMoDO9soJ).  I don't think this is readable by most mathematicians.  It certainly starts off pretty crazy, trying to link the Zeta function to protons, electrons, and neutrons: that was classic Ludwig, and no I will not try to explain any of this craziness.

- [Terry Tao's reply](https://groups.google.com/g/sci.math/c/2m-jqsZYZW8/m/mzsA_xkg26YJ).  It is amazing that Tao makes sense out of a lot of what Plutonium writes, and even says at the beginning that Tao is ""absolutely correct so far.""  Towards the middle, Tao finds problems, saying ""This already makes this proof invalid, but let's continue anyway.""  And the more Tao goes, the more flaws he finds.

In the reply after that, Plutonium writes: ""I HAVE MADE SOME TYPOS, AND MINOR ERRORS IN MY 9JAN94, 16:30:33 GMT POSTING.""  Sorry about the all caps, I am just cut-and-pasting his text.  I think he gets the time of the post wrong, but yeah he gets a lot of things wrong.  What I find significant about this quoted text is that this is the only time I have ever seen Plutonium admit being wrong to anything.

I hope this brings a smile to some of the people here who have been around internet discussions for a very long time.  I'd be keen to see of other examples like this, or even similar stories whether they are documented or not.  Thank you for reading.

,,What did Cantor think about Frege's Basic Law V?,TheDarkSingularity,1619388775,"I know I keep coming back, but this gets more interesting as I study it more.

Cantor defined sets as ""well-defined"" collections of objects. This seems like a conservative approach to sets (Cantor was kicking the can down the road for future set theorists to formalize), in contrast to Frege, who seemed to make a lot of bold statements about sets (some of which were inconsistent). 

Did Cantor believe Basic Law V? This seems like a very plausible statement for Cantor to believe, since Cantor was not aware of Russell's paradox (at the time). I would have believed Naive Comprehension immediately - it seems so natural to want a set of all sets that share a property. Was Cantor just like: ""Nah, that's too scary, Frege - I'll just use the wording *well-defined* so that I can be right, by definition, for the rest of time, and so that if anybody in the future discovers problems with Basic Law V, then it would be Frege that's wrong, not me.""

Moreover, according to the footnotes of this article: [https://philarchive.org/archive/BREFBL](https://philarchive.org/archive/BREFBL), ""As also often retold Russell discovered his paradox by working through the proof Cantor gave of (CT); in effect Russell’s argument is only a special case of Cantor’s more general argument. And Russell told Frege about this in a letter."" (page 4).

I'm just really confused how Cantor looks like he was ahead of his time. WHY?

That conservative position makes me wonder why Cantor was conservative, when he had no reason to deny NC... Did Cantor know that Basic Law V was wrong after he proved Cantor's Theorem?",math

This is carrying on the experience from the chess community, but I think it is valid for every non trivial field of knowledge (and chess is a fraction of the size of many real world fields like math, physics, medicine and so on). 

In the chess community the consensus is that is much harder, in terms of effort needed, to get the Grandmaster title than getting a PhD.  (where talent defines the ceiling that one can reach through hard work)

What do I want to say with this? As many in [this submission said](https://old.reddit.com/r/math/comments/my6a59/i_ended_my_time_as_a_math_student_this_week/), is that higher education degrees requires first and foremost persistence (that is not an easy thing), so don't get discouraged by the gatekeeping. If that wouldn't be the case, it wouldn't make sense to put the GM title over a PhD in terms of perceived difficulty (well aside from very few competitive PhD openings in this world)

------

Side note: Some realization may click better in a field than in another. Chess, being competitive and quantified, clarifies (well at least for me) many things that I think apply elsewhere, but aren't as immediate to realize in those other domains. For example in chess many think that being smart, for some values of being smart, is enough, but one quickly realizes the value of hard work (and thus they are humbled). 

In educational domains one may think that being smart is enough because one can get through thanks to cramming, at least in some institutions, and thus one may have the wrong impression that higher degrees are achievable only with if one is very smart. Hence my post.",math

I'll try to keep this short. I'm just looking for some general advice; I know specific steps I should take will ultimately decide on what I want to do.

I'm about to finish my 2nd year at college. Initially, I came in as pre-med and switched to mathematics in my 2nd semester. Originally I wanted to full-send pure math, but I've realized lately that I'm much more interested in applied math - specifically computational molecular biology. My end goal is to try and get a PhD in such a field.

My one concern is - I feel like in terms of mathematics, I will be ""underprepared"" for approaching a graduate program in applied math. Some math courses I've taken:

Calculus 1-3
Linear Algebra, 2 semesters (one intro, one more theoretical)
Probability (discrete and continuous)
Abstract Algebra (2 semesters)
Ordinary Diff Eqs
Differential Geometry
Mathematical modeling (difference eqns, 1D and 2D models, some MATLAB programming)

Some courses I plan to take in the future:
Numerical methods
Partial differential eqns
Complex analysis*
Linear models**
Time series analysis**
Programming in python

*Likely won't take, since I'd have to take it while doing my senior thesis, but I do want to take it
**Pending if I can take intro stats 2 in the fall - I screwed up hard and skipped intro stats 2 this spring for geometry, dont know if these will be possible

I also will need to balance some other bio courses on top of all that, which I already somewhat have a plan for.

My main question is - what other things should I focus on getting down solid to increase my chances for grad school? I feel like compared to other programs, I'd have little applied math curriculum - theres also a large chance I will have essentially no stats background. For any applied mathematicians out there (or anyone else with some insight), do you have general advice for someone a little late on the track like me?

,,"I made a simple generalization of cellular automata, allowing for a rule to support an arbitrary number of states and it has some interesting properties",ImportantContext,1619324861,"(Sorry in advance if this is hard to read, my English isn't particularly great.)

The main idea of this generalization is to replace finite transition table with a function (R^n -&gt; R or Z^n -&gt; Z) that maps cell and its neighbors to a new state. Additionally, it requires the output of this function to be equal to one of its inputs. 

I explored a few approaches to constructing such functions, with additional requirements of symmetry under grid rotation, ability to compute this function quickly and balance between simplistic and noisy behaviors. 

One approach is to first sort neighbors, compute the weighted sum of sorted neighbors (hash), map this hash to an integer value and use this value to choose neighbor.

Here's an example implementation: https://www.shadertoy.com/view/fsfSDf, with default configuration showing a range of interesting behaviors: spirals similar to rock-paper-scissors CA, still-life patters, islands of chaos, replicators and gliders.

Another approach is to split neighborhood into subsets that are symmetric under rotation, assign each subset a weight and compute a weighted sum, choosing the neighbor that has the closest value to this sum to be the new state. 

An example implementation is available here: https://www.shadertoy.com/view/fdXSDf, this version uses the [central cell value and sum of all neighbors](https://i.imgur.com/jZjW51d.png) to compute the hash value. Interestingly, it seems to produce complex worm-like structures that seem to have a very unique set of behaviors. At least I haven't seen this type of behavior in other CAs. 

Another example: https://www.shadertoy.com/view/NdXSDf, this uses 5x5 cell neighborhood and splits it into [outer 16 cells, inner 8 cells and one central cell](https://i.imgur.com/7C0d5E3.png) to compute hash. This one shows complex, stripped worm-like structures surrounded by chaotic soup. 

These constructions basically encode a (finite) CA rule into cell states. If you restrict input to only two states, it's easy to map the behavior to a standard two-state CA rule, though resulting CAs will never include transitions where a cell changes into a state outside of values within the neighborhood. Same thing is true for any number of states (less or equal to the number of cells in neighborhood). 

I wonder if it's possible to construct a transition function such that for any suitable CA rule it's possible to find cell values that will behave like such CA rule under this transition function. But my math abilities struggle with expressing this type of questions, let alone finding an answer

What if there is a mix of blue- and brown-eyed islanders who missed the announcement?

On first pass, it seems like if all those who missed the memo are brown-eyed, nothing will change. 

On the other hand, if any of those who missed the memo are blue-eyed, does the problem fall apart? Does anyone end up leaving ever? 

Since those who miss the announcement are presumably perfect logicians as well, does any sudden exodus have additional effects later on?

Does this change if those who heard the announcement know exactly who was present, as opposed to simply knowing that some were absent?

I try to be short. I've a very close friend of mine who says he extremely loves math and that's the thing he wants to spend his life doing. the guy is excellent in lots of things (his writing ability is superb!). he didn't spend a lot of time on math in high school but (somehow and I don't want to disclose it) currently studies in a top math school with lots of excellent students who have been putting a lot of hard work since HS to be able to attend this school.

I can say that attending this school ruined his self-confidence. there's always someone who's been a programmer since 10 or even medalist or so. So his start was quite harsh, he even failed a few of his courses but all along I encouraged him and told him how expected was his situation, I told him his peers have been working on Math for a longer time and a good portion of them are still working much harder than you so what's happening is very natural.

Now he's halfway through his bachelor, he didn't give up, since last year he's maybe putting 25-30 hours weekly (not including class times ofc) into his studies, from what I can estimate, he's in the top 40% of the students there. 

The problem is he still has **huge** doubt around his intelligence or IQ. he says he can't see himself be great at Math but still is giving it a shot.

I honestly think everything is normal here. maybe there are super geniuses do magnificent things with 20 hrs/week but the people I've seen closely, study 40-50 hrs/week for years to the best at math or engineering and they all have great fundamentals in HS. overall I think he's on the right track and is doing good, certainly not underperforming! 

Since he himself has doubts, I just felt maybe I'm biased or haven't seen math geniuses(?). so am I doing him a favor by encouraging him or maybe he's not fit for math (is there even such a thing)?",math

,,Why does exponentiation suck so much?,AinsleyBoy,1619281085,"This post is half rant and half discussion.

Don't get me wrong, I'm fine dealing with logs, roots and powers. I just feel like they themselves suck. A lot.

The first thing that really annoys me with them is **roots**. Everytime I see a root, I die inside just a bit. I just hate the concept that sometimes there are two answers to one equation. It creates such a mess, and dealing with roots makes math so much uglier, and much less fun. Sometimes some of the answers you get with roots are LITERALLY NOT TRUE and you have to check them. I just hate it as a concept. It ruins the beauty. The most horrible thing is that roots are so broken that you can literally graph an abs(x) function by doing sqrt(x^2). I die from that. It just shows you how inconsistent and ugly roots are, right in your face. That expression should be simplified into just (x). But it's not. Because of roots.

The other thing is again to do with roots, but this time it's about both roots AND logarithms. It's so weird to me that after multiplication, you need to inverse functions: one for the base, and one for the power.
It breaks so many patterns that hold so beautifully with addition and multiplication and just slaps you in the face with how ugly it is. Furthermore, the confusion between which one is the ""true"" inverse function is really annoying. The answer is ITS BOTH, because roots are for finding the BASE when knowing the result and the power (nth root of x), and logarithms are for finding the POWER when knowing the result and the base (log base n of x).

Exponentiation just seems like such an ugly mess. Of course it's incredibly useful, but just when looking at how logical and mathematically consistent it is, I feel like math kinda breaks down when you reach that level.

If we take a simple 2d magnitude of vectors of the the values (2,0),(0,2) it will equal the hypotenuse of a 2d triangle, similarly the magnitude of the vectors of a 3d triangle by (2,0,0),(020),(0,0,2) will equal the longest diagonal of a 3d triangle. This is simple enough to imagine, in 3 dimensional space the hypotenuse is but a single length of line. Although when the magnitude of or hypotenuse of a triangle in 4d space is found, the length of the diagonal is characterised by the area of parrelelogram in 2d space, further in 5d the length of the diagonal of a triangle is characterised by the volume of a parrelelogram in 3d. Simply then, in order to imagine what the hypotenuse of a 5d triangle might look like, we simply have to take the volume of a parrelelogram in 3d which on the relevant sides corresponds to the vector lengths appropriately.

Once you feed a box to the machine, it will go in one of two queues: one for the small ones, one for the big ones. Both queues have the same number of slots. 

Before they enter their respective queue, all boxes wait to be sorted on a conveyor belt. 

Every time there is a cake order, one slot is freed in one of the queues. If there is an order for a small cake, one slot from the small box queue is freed, and the same applies for big cake orders. 

You have no way of knowing in advance which size of cake will be ordered. You only know there are usually more small cake orders. 

Here is the trick: if you feed more small boxes than there are slots in the queue to the machine, then the conveyor belt will be clogged up with small boxes and the big boxes will have to wait until they are transferred to their queue. This is a problem because if there are no big boxes in the queue and there is a big cake order, the order will have to be delayed an indeterminate amount of time until there have been enough small cake orders to free the entrance of the queues.

So if instead we use AC\_ω (countable choice) on the set of computable elements of X, (which is always countable,) we still have formalized that intuitive notion of ""take one x that satisfies the property"", but we don't run into the shady nonsense that AC infers.

Beware though, that just with AC\_ω we actually could run into the same non-intuitive ""pick a non computable element"", since you can have a countable set of non-computable elements.

,,Breadth vs depth (undergraduate),NinjaGandhi,1619258169,"For an undergraduate maths student who wants to study more maths over the summer, do you think it is better to go for breadth or depth?

What I mean by this is that you could potentially spend the whole summer studying topics not directly on you course’s syllabus, thereby expanding the horizons of you knowledge. Or you could go for depth by either (i) studying a second course of a topic you have already encountered, or (ii) studying a topic that you will encounter in future years on the course in order to get early exposure.

On the one hand, going for breadth seems appealing because you get to study topics that you have an interest in but you wouldn’t normally be able to study.

But going for depth has the advantage of (i) gaining further insight into topics already encountered and (ii) getting early exposure to ideas that you will encounter later on, which could lead to deeper understanding when you do encounter them again at university.

I realise it may not be as black and white as this since studying extracurricular topics may still lead to deeper understanding of previous topics by tying together different areas of maths (e.g. combinatorial group theory brings combinatorics and group theory together).

I found [this paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/271.pdf) which has me very excited. I am contemplating the nature of community and verification, and how group verification strengthens our understanding. The [Socratic method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_method) itself can be virtualized and decentralized. Allow me to paint you a picture:

Imagine a website which connects to your r/cosmosnetwork similar interchain wallet. You carry a token called γιγ (gig), say. This website is similar to reddit or StackExchange. You can write proofs, programs, and other ""formal utilities"" (useful information) in an open ecosystem of formal languages. A stack of neural networks distributes offers between various services on this *utility exchange*. For example, the website will curate a list of offers on a blog post you wrote to your personal platform on the site. The offers will include responses from other users about the content, as well as automated language transformation services (akin to GPT-n) which can translate your ideas into a variety of increasingly-formal utilities. These utilities can be used to produce new content of increasing utility and value, as content will have a tendency to be improved in clarity, form, and representation. The goal of the openness, and of the decentralization generally, is to facilitate a platform which does not allow favor to be placed by institutions on certain branches of research and development in the formal sciences.

The only way to make this idea concrete is to hash out the actual economics of formal utility. The quantifiable utility of proof, information, translation, language, verification, consensus. All of these very different abstract entities are bound together in a game-semantic paradigm by a concept of formal utility. I don't think a discussion about this can fail to acknowledge the inevitability of ""math on the chain"". If we can get ahead of all this, we can avoid the pains and struggles of huge organizations leveraging technological advances against the majority of life on earth, and against the interests of those who will benefit most from learning more about the harmony of the world.

,,Shitty approximation of pi,PaboBormot,1619231853,"Apologies for messy formatting.. the question is just a mess to formulate.

**Definitions:**

Consider S^1 = [0, 1]/~ under the round sphere metric.

We call a function f: S^1 -&gt; R^2 **double Lipschitz** if there exists constants k and K &gt; 0 such that for every x, y with x =/= y we have k &lt; |f(x) - f(y)|/|x - y| &lt; K. We call c and C the upper and lower Lipschitz constants of f respectively.

We denote by B^2 the unit closed ball in R^2 around the origin.

Consider the unit sphere S^1 as a subset of R^2 and let c: S^1 -&gt; R^2 be the inclusion map.

Consider a sequence c_i: S^1 -&gt; R^2 of double Lipschitz simple closed curves with uniform upper and lower Lipschitz constants k and K.

Suppose also that c_i(0) = c_i(1) = (1, 0), c_i lies in R^2\B^2 for each i, and c_i -&gt; c in sup norm.

**Question:**

Is it true that there exists a constant D &lt; infty depending only on k, K such that for all such closed curves c_i, limsup A(c_i) &lt; D? Where A denotes the arc length function. Can we express D in terms of k, K?",math
,,Visualising and conceptualising up to 5 dimensions,qrqtowyt,1619230658,"
So recently I have been learning linear algebra and I was reading about a scenario in which scalars were multiplying vectors in a 5 dimensional space. Up until that point I could easily visualise the magnitude of a vector in 3 dimensional space, but 4 and 5 dimensions Is a bit of stretch. I had a think for a bit but sadly, I don't think I could successfully visualise 4 or more dimension vector magnitude. I thought a 4 dimensional vector magnitude would look like some variation of a 3 dimensional parrelelogram given vectors of (2,2,2,2) but the maths did not check out. That being said, I had some interesting insights on visualising, conceptualising and drawing on analogies to understand 4 and 5 dimensional space and I would like to see what you guys think.

Imagine a person at a party walking across a room the entire night, what if we could create an image of every position that person was ever in in that entire night, like a long exposure camera photo. Then, what if from this image we could intuitively tell in what order each position took place and further, could tell the length of time in each incremental position, that is mathematically the first derivative of time, if you could comprehend these things in real time, you would be able to see in 4 dimensions (including everything that changes at the party additional to the person). I imagine if you could create a direction of arrows connecting each position at any point in time, consecutively, and perhaps add additional lighting or colour to a position to indicate the time spent in that position, if you were smart enough to interpret this, to the same extent we interpret a 3 dimensional graph, then you could effectively see a representation of 4 dimensions.

Mathematically a graph of 4 dimensions might just represent the combined super impositions of the 3 dimensional cross sections taking place over time, with some indication of direction and time. This might just look like a cluster filled mess of 3 dimensional objects. Similarly, you could create a 5 dimensional space which is full of super impositions of 4 dimensional object's that indicates direction and possibilities that change with time. That is as time changes the very very large number of possibilities could change intersecting and super imposing all the possible 4 dimensional object's. If you used colour to indicate possiblity paths and lighting to indicate time, assuming the cluster of possibilities isn't insanely large (which it certainly will be) the direction, colour and lighting could make it feasible to understand what the 5d representation is telling you.

I imagine using models like this could have value for analysis, for example, if you take a sample from a 4d model, you could find the amount of time spent in a particular position and the number of times position entered it. The density and lighting could intuitively reveal information, if used in conjunction with other information such as the time value for all the data in the sample.

Anyway, these were just my thoughts on higher dimensions, let me know what you think!",math

Am I missing something here?",TheDarkSingularity,1619222397,"I translated one of Cantor's articles, and saw that he defined a set to be \~ a collection of *well-defined* objects \~ which does *not* seem to logically imply Russell's paradox, considering the notion *well-defined* can require ZFC-axioms, and so on, right? Cantor doesn't go on to explain what *well-defined* really means (at least as far as I read), but that's not really the point. There's a problem when you say that sets are collections of objects, since there are collections of objects that should definitely not be sets. I don't see a problem when you add the requirement that the collection is well-defined, since this removes ambiguity in whatever way you want, depending on how you want to remove ambiguity.

I notice textbooks use universes to try to solve the problem of naive set theory in an attempt to kick the philosophical can down the road into courses that are more suitable for discussion on ZFC-axioms, and Cantor's use of *well-defined* seems very analogous to that solution. Am I missing something? Was Cantor really the author of naive set theory? Was Russell solving a paradox that was already kind-of solved by Cantor here? Did Cantor know why he needed to use that wording *well-defined*? This makes me feel like naive set theory was never invented until math textbooks decided to get really lazy with their philosophy, and that Russell is getting credit for correcting Cantor, who seems to be correct anyways? Maybe I'm wrong though, and that's why I'm here :D",math

That would work really well for things with small rs of big Rs, but is just an approximation. Like how finding the area of a circle with a circle cut out of it isn’t just taking the width of the remaining bit times the amount that it goes around, but rather requires you to take the big circle and subtract the area of the small circle.

I aspire to be an algebraist and/or topologist someday (planning to immediately apply for a PhD after undergrad) and i am worried of my current understanding of NT to the point that i almost always tackle homework from an algebraic perspective e.g. for congruence modulo n i immediately think of it as arithmetic in the ring Z_{n} and for the totient function the multiplicative group of units of Z_{n}, etc. Also, the proofs presented to us never seem to click unless i rephrase it using algebraic terminology.

Basically I have a pneumatic valve arm on a moving body (like a linear rail slide). It will be striking a fixed object to trip the valve / ""break the switch""

My conditions are such that the valve arm is moving at 16.66m/s and the arm itself has a mass of 2kg. As the valve arm hits the stationary object, technically it travels an arc as it rotates out of the neutral position, but to keep things simple I've resolved the arc into a linear distance of 0.09m. After 0.09m the trip valve has rotated enough that it now passes over the stationary object and continues on as it is still attached to the moving body. 

So my question is how do I find the impact force imparted on the stationary object? 

I have taken two approaches. 

1. I assume that the valve arm is decelerated from 16.66m/s to zero over a certain period of time. The time I am using is 0.09m / 16.66m/s = 0.005 seconds. My rationale is that the moving body which the valve arm is attached to is sufficiently large that it's momentum is not affected. So the whole assembly keeps going at 16.66m/s but the rotating valve arm essentially ""stops"" over this period of time as it imparts some force on the stationary object.   
Therefore the arm experiences an acceleration over time. (0m/s - 16.66m/s) / 0.005s = 3332 m/s\^2  
Using F = ma then F = 2kg \* 3332m/s\^2 = 6664N  

2. In the second approach I look at the energy involved. Kinetic energy of the arm is 1/2mv\^2. The result is (0.5)(2kg)(16.66m/s)\^2 = 277.5 J  
When the moving valve arm strikes the stationary object, it's kinetic energy will be lost as it is decelerated to 0m/s over the 0.09m distance. This is a form of work. Work  = F\*d  
Then I should be able to say that 277.5 J = F \* 0.09m where F = 3083N  


This is where I am confused. I get different answers for the force using the two methods. But in both methods the values used are the same, and the time used in newtons method and the distance used in the work energy principle are connected to one another by the velocity. So what am I missing? Is one approach correct or are both the incorrect way of looking at this problem?

Hope someone can help! Thank you",math

,,Winning at Battleship Using Probability,challenging-luck,1619141456," I  recently built a bot in python that can play the Battleship board game using probability. The bot is able to guess where all the ships are in  54 turns on average. This average was found by placing ships randomly and seeing how the bot does.

The bot builds the probability of where ships might be based on the hits and misses that have been on the board so far.

,,What made you fall in love with math?,scarlett_w3,1619122273,"^(Sorry in advance if this gets asked a lot, feel free to take down my post since I wasn't sure if this is allowed.)

First things first; sadly, I hate math. 

I have been struggling so much to do it, it genuinely just scares me and feels like a chore, and I feel like I've tried a lot to not feel this way about it - the only thing that appeals to me is the problem solving aspect when I'm working with a topic I've managed to understand, which unfortunately doesn't happen often.

I feel like the only way around this (because I need to learn some math for a course I'm doing) is to learn to like it. And I know I should be able to somehow, because logical, problem solving and brain-exercise type of activities and games really appeal to me (for example I love programming which I've discovered very recently and I was able to self-teach myself up to a very decent level within a year or so) so it's not like I'm not leaning towards that type of thing as a whole.

I have heard from others that they hated math too at first and got overwhelmed by it like I am, but they suddenly found something that made math just *click* or them, and ever since they grew to love it and ended up picking it up faster and faster due to their motivation and appreciation of it, and those stories give me hope, but I have no idea how to go about finding that thing for myself that's going to help me get that click. 

So I guess, I'm just wondering what those things are for you, whether it be something very specific (like a book or a story or anything concrete) or any kind of process that led to you finally loving math, especially if you stated off on the opposite end. Approaches to how to learn it in an enjoyable manner are also welcome if that's how you did it. 

----

Bonus info about me in case you have things in common and you worked through/with those in your journey to like math: 

I have ADHD and I probably also have discalculia. The things that made me feel most interested in math are when I hear about how it's used to find patterns in nature and places you wouldn't have expected, [The Code](https://m.imdb.com/title/tt2060305/) documentary had a lot of stuff I found very interesting and inspiring and I'd love to know if there's anything else like that I could watch/read. Also anything like the things mentioned in Veritasium's [This equation will change how you see the world](https://youtu.be/ovJcsL7vyrk), as well as Vsauce's video on the [Banach Tarski Paradox](https://youtu.be/s86-Z-CbaHA).

I also feel that what I struggle with the most in math is the theory, having to remember all these blocks of knowledge and how they work and interact with each other (especially considering I'm kind of starting from zero every time I try to learn math and when I put it aside I forget most things very fast and have to start all over again).

,,Found e while optimizing a video rendering algorithm!,mjklol710,1619121708,"Hi all! I have a fractal rendering app that I develop and recently decided to start working on rendering zoom videos. I implemented a naive approach that just rendered one frame, zoomed in a little bit, and rendered the next frame from scratch for a certain number of frames. Then I got to thinking about how I might optimize this. I figured if I rendered a keyframe at a higher resolution, say twice the size of my desired output resolution, then I could subsample this higher resolution render for several frames, just stretching the image a little each frame to have the appearance of zooming. Of course, this stops working once you've stretched the image to twice its size, because then you don't have enough pixel density to maintain the original output resolution.

I knew there would be a tradeoff between how much longer the higher resolution renders would take and how much time I would save by not rendering those extra frames, so I decided to figure out what the optimal value is for increasing the resolution, if any, and found something cool!

&amp;#x200B;

[Here](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/d803mkmsxd) is the Desmos graph I made which might make it easier to read some of the equations!

&amp;#x200B;

First, some variables:

w\_1 : width of output resolution

w\_2 : width of higher resolution

t\_1 : time to render one frame at output resolution

t\_2 : time to render one frame at higher resolution

F : total number of frames in the video

s : number of frames skipped for each high-res frame rendered

z : zoom amount every frame (usually this is a number just a little bigger than 1)

v\_1 : time to render video with naive implementation

v\_2 : time to render video with frame skipping

&amp;#x200B;

We can say that w\_2 is just a constant multiple c of w\_1, that is, w\_2 = c\*w\_1

We can then derive that t\_2 is just c\^2\*t\_1 because of the two-dimensionality of images

To determine s, we use the fact that we can continue skipping frames as long as the amount we've zoomed since the last frame doesn't exceed our constant c. In other words we skip frames until z\^s = a, or s = log\_z(c). Now we have all the numbers necessary to calculate the time of each video!

v\_1 = F\*t\_1

v\_2 = F/s \* t\_2 = F/s \* c\^2\*t\_1

Now we just divide v\_2 by v\_1 to see how the render times compare:

v\_2/v\_1 = c\^2/log\_z(c)

If we plot as a function of c, where z is still some constant a little greater than 1, we can see there is a portion of the curve that dips below 1, meaning the frame skipping method is faster for all those values of c! Now, which value of c nets the greatest improvement? The derivative of the equation we just plotted with respect to c is:

( 2c\*log\_z(c) - c/ln(z) )  /  ( log\_z(c) )\^2

If we set this to 0 and solve for c the answer is....

sqrt(e) !!!!

So no matter what our zoom constant z is, the frame skipping method is most efficient when the width of the higher-resolution image is sqrt(e) times the width of our output resolution! I just thought it was so incredible and neat to find e hiding in this problem!

tl;dr e is everywhere",math

,,Methods to determine if a number is an integer?,saturnlight88,1619109244,"I came across [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/mvg20q/a_question_about_the_randomness_of_pi/gvc30qh) made in a post yesterday, and it set me down an internet rabbit hole. u/Chand_laBing points out that technically, e\^e\^e\^79 hasn't been shown to be a non-integer because it's simply too large a number to compute its value precisely. And while that (annoyingly) makes sense, I was genuinely shocked that such a simple fact about a number couldn't be determined without calculating its value. (We can infer that this number has no real chance of being an integer, but proving it is hard).

&amp;#x200B;

That got me thinking: Is there any method or test to distinguish an integer from a non-integer? And if not, why is it so hard? 

&amp;#x200B;

Taken on its face, it seems simple to tell if a number is an integer — we look at its digits and see if it has any fractional component. (A number that lies between two consecutive integers can also be shown not to be an integer.)

&amp;#x200B;

But as a test, looking at its digits has an obvious problem. First, it doesn't work when we can't calculate a number's digits (as in e\^e\^e\^79). But second, it requires an infinite level of precision to state definitively that a number is an integer. Take for example 5. We know it's an integer. But we only know it's an integer because we define it to be an integer. If we look at its digits, 5.00000000000..., it seems like we are never able to satisfactorily conclude, just by looking at the digits, that the 0s go on forever.   


Say for example e\^e\^e\^79 is really close to some integer n, such that its value is calculated to be n + 0.00000000000000... Would we ever be able to conclude if e\^e\^e\^79=n and is not just *really really* close to n?  


It seems to me the only way to know for certain that a number is an integer is if it is constructed from integers. We know (51\^3)\*(98\^45)-(6!-4887\^78\^43) is an integer without calculating its value. And if e\^e\^e\^79 could be shown to be equal to a similar expression, then that would work. But barring that, is there any test? Although I know of no examples of integers constructed from irrational numbers, say one exists. Would it ever be possible to show it is an integer?",math

Today I learning about infinite geometric series with finite sums, and thought “could there be a finite geometric series (or series of any kind) with an infinite sum?”.

My first though was that the ratio *r* could be set to an equation with itself in it, for example *r=2+2r*, and in that way end up with a sum equation (Sn=a1(1-r^(n)/1-r) where r ends up being infinite.

But then I realize any sensible person would just solve *r=2+2r* to get *r=-2*.

But I’m still wondering, is there any possible situation with any time of sequence, which would result in a finite sequence having an infinite sum? If not, is there a mathematical proof of that?

No, x÷0 isn't 0, and it isn't infinity either. The real answer to 1÷0 or 1.2345÷0 is impossible to tell. It is mathematically not defined as a number. It's like trying to calculate the slope of a Y parallel line. It isn't defined and doesn't have a number.  

Now in some instances x÷0 can be infinity. But in these cases, the 0 has to be something that in my native language is called ""haddi"". I don't fully understand it either, it is very complicated and confusing but I know that it's not concidered a number, it is considered a meaning, a definition if you will. 

Also: 0÷0 doesn't equal 1, nor infinity, nor 0. It is also, undefined. 

So yeah, Don't go telling people how 1÷0 is 0 or infinity.  The truth is that as of yet, there is just no way for us to solve 1÷0. It doesn't have a real answer. And also,

1a. Sticking to finitist frameworks are too difficult to get interesting and useful results

1b. The (interact-able) universe is not finite.

1c. Even if equally expressive finitist theories were able to be constructed, they would have to be based heavily upon the insights from our initially infinite approach and wouldn't contain as much novel value as you might think.

1d.  Infinities always provide utility in excess of what can be done with a finite counterpart

However, in favor of the **finite**:

2a. As computation is improving, computable work becomes more and more relevant to applications.

2b. We don't know if the universe is infinite (and may never know).

One can evaluate the series not just at finite values of the expansion parameter but also at infinity.

 I explain the details of how this works using the example of computing the limit of arctan(x) for x to infinity using only the first few terms of its series expansion.

,,An absolute inverse function?,AinsleyBoy,1618949795,"Everyone knows the absolute value function, which measures distance from the origin.

In practice (for the reals), it makes negative numbers positive, and keeps positive numbers positive.

Now, for every x and (-x), there is the property that says that x+(-x)=0, which is the additive identity.

This is called the additive inverse, which you probably already knew, but I only found out about recently.

Multiplication also has this: for every x and 1/x, x\*1/x=1 (1 is the multiplicative identity). 1/x is also knows as just the ""inverse"" of x.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, I connected some dots and thought: what if there was an absolute... inverse? The function would make it so for x between (-1) and 1, The output would be 1/x, and for any other x, it'd output x.

A piecewise function of this would look like: ABN(x) = {-1&lt;x&lt;1: (1/x), x}

And if you like making non-piecewise functions as a challenge like me, it'd look like:

f(x) = sign(sign(x)+1) 🡲 just [Heaviside step function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaviside_step_function) but f(0)=1

g(x) = f(x) - 0.5f(-|*x*|) 🡲 f(x) but x=0 gives 0.5

ABN(x) = (g(1-|*x*|)/x) + (x\*g(|*x*|-1))

So far, I've found no differences between the two.

I can see this function being useful in situations similar to the situations where |*x*| is useful in: when you don't know which number is bigger than which. with |*x*|, it's when you subtract two numbers. But with ABN(x), It'd be when trying to find the ration between two numbers. If you try to see if one number is a multiple of another, you can't say it's when (x/y) is an integer, because you risk (y) being bigger than (x), and it being 1/\[num\]. But, if (x) is a multiple of (y) or vice-versa, inputting ABN(x/y) [will always grant you an integer](http://imgur.com/a/VOOW2fs), which I think is useful.

,,Why (some) particles have mass and spin,tipf,1618935087,"There is a [really cool application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wigner%27s_classification) of representation theory to physics which philosophically explains where mass and spin come from (in a sense at least). Let me try to explain this from the ground up to maybe incentivize more people to learn about physics -- there's some really good math in there!

To begin, in special relativity one equips space-time R\^4 with a different inner product than usual: g(v, w) = v\^0 w\^0 - v\^1 w\^1 - v\^2 w\^2 - v\^3 w\^3 (the upper indices  refer to the components of the vectors, as is customary in physic). To briefly see why, consider that g(v, v) = 0 if and only if (v\^0)\^2 = (v\^1)\^2 + (v\^2)\^2 + (v\^3)\^2, which if you think of this as a velocity vector means you're dealing with something that 'moves as much in time as it does in space', i.e. light (using c = 1). It's possible to [push this logic further](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivations_of_the_Lorentz_transformations#Invariance_of_interval) to show that all observers agree on this inner product. That is to say that the allowable changes of coordinates in R\^4 are those which preserve this metric. The ones fixing the origin are automatically linear and form the Lorentz group O(1, 3), whose connected component of the identity is SO+(1,3) (the Lorentz transformations that preserve both time and space orientations). If you also allow translations of spacetime you get the Poincaré group (with connected component of the identity) R\^4 |x SO+(1,3) (this is my shitty ASCII attempt at a semi-direct product sign).

Now let's bring quantum mechanics into the picture. In QM, the state of a system is described via a vector in a Hilbert space. So let's suppose we want a Hilbert space which describes the possible states of some type of elementary particle. If we want a relativistic theory, then different observers should agree on the state -- this doesn't mean they see the same state, but rather that given an element of the Poincaré group, there should be a unitary transformation of this Hilbert space that maps the state one of them sees to the state the other sees. This means our Hilbert space needs to come with a unitary representation of the Poincaré group! But actually, not quite -- in QM it makes no difference if you multiply your state vector by some unit complex number. So it should really be a representation 'up to multiplication by a unit complex number', which is called a projective representation. [A theorem of Bargmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_representation#Infinite-dimensional_projective_unitary_representations:_Bargmann's_theorem) guarantees that these all come from honest unitary representations of the universal cover, which in our case turns out to be R\^4 |x SL(2, C). Also, since our particle is supposed to be elementary, we want our representation to be irreducible -- or else we'd be in some sense describing two (or more) possible kinds of particle.

So the mathematical question presents itself: what are all the possible irreducible unitary representations of the group G = R\^4 |x SL(2, C)? This is what Wigner did (and later Mackey elevated to a machinery). I'll just tell you what the answer is, but even that requires some setup. Consider some point p in R\^4, and let H\_p be the subgroup of elements of SL(2, C) which fix p. It turns out that there is a way to take any irreducible unitary rep of H\_p and produce another irreducible unitary rep of G. Moreover, all unitary irreps (= irreducible representation) of G arise this way. Let's denote by pi\_(p, sigma) the unitary irrep of G that comes out of the unitary irrep sigma of H\_p. Then, finally, two pi\_(p, sigma) and pi\_(p', sigma') are equivalent as reps of G if and only if p' = Bp for some B in SL(2, C), and sigma is equivalent to A |-&gt; sigma'(BAB\^-1).

The upshot is that we need to understand what are the orbits of SL(2, C) in R\^4, and for each possible orbit pick a representative point p, understand what is H\_p (the 'little group of p') and what are its unitary irreps. One type of orbit is: X\_m+ = {p in R\^4 | g(p, p) = m\^2 and p\_0 &gt; 0} for some real parameter m &gt;= 0. In the m &gt; 0 case we can pick the representative p = (m, 0, 0, 0). Turns out that H\_p = SU(2)! The irreps of SU(2) are classified by a parameter s = 0, 1/2, 1, 3/2, 2, .... called the spin -- I could explain this point further but I think the post is getting too long already. (By the way, in the m = 0 case you get a different group, which is why massless particles don't really have spin but something called helicity instead.)

Let me end with one important point: as far as we know, this m is just some real parameter -- what gives us the right to call it mass? Aha - the point is to compute how spacetime translations act according to the representation we obtained. Noether figured out a long time ago that if you differentiate the actions of time and space translations you get energy and momentum respectively! It can be shown that the operator E\^2 - |p|\^2 in our setting equals multiplication by m\^2, reproducing the famous relativity identity E\^2 = |p|\^2 + m\^2 (in some sense). That is why m is really the mass, and that's how massive particles turn out to have spin.",math

,,Using Binomial Distribution to provide Margins of Error on spot checks,Skyenar,1618914158,"I am doing some work linking 2 large datasets together and then spot checking individual records to make sure the overall result looks reasonable. I wanted to use binomial distribution to provide a margin of error to my spot checks. 

The overall result from the data linking showed 19% of records matched. Spot checking these I had 1 in 15 return a match. If I made the assumption that the actual records that should be matched was 28% then binomial distribution tells me the chances of returning 1 or less matched records would be 5%. To me this tells me that the chances of the overall matching record being over 28% (based on my spot checks) is 5%. I also note there is a 5% chance this result would be produced if the overall matching record was under 2.43%.

Is this true and anybody help me try explain this correctly. Also, should I be actually looking at 2.5% chance of it being over and under to produce a 95% confidence that the results falls between 1.65% and 32%.

,,How should multiplication be taught in elementary school?,singletonking,1618908121,"I have noticed that multiplication of two integers e.g. 2 x 3 is to be interpreted as ""2 groups of 3"", and therefore to be calculated as 3 + 3, as opposed to e.g. 2 + 2 + 2. I have been penalised for such ""errors"" in my homework before, which had me annoyed, and I believe many people here have been too. 

Currently, I am no longer sure if those ""errors"" are actual errors or not. I think many people still do not agree view the above as errors, but I have some points to make for those being errors:

* Two expressions which have the same *value* are still different. For example, 3 + 7, 14 - 4, and 2 x 5 all have the same value of 10, and yet all clearly have different interpretations. If we stick to the interpretation of ""n x m"" as ""n groups of m"", then n x m should indeed be evaluated as m + ... + m (n times), and not n + ... + n (m times). In the case of integer multiplication, these results happen to be always the same due to the commutative law, but the two expressions n x m and m x n still have different interpretations. 
* The equality of n x m and m x n is true because of the commutative law of multiplication of integers. However, this may not hold true in some other branches of mathematics, such as group theory. 
* Building on to the first point, the idea of n x m being ""n groups of m"", or ""n copies of m"", can be further generalised to m being in any algebra where addition is defined and is associative. For example, in rings, if m is a ring element, we often write 3 · m to mean m + m + m, which follows from the definition. On the other hand, m · 3 is not written; while we would probably interpret it the same way, it would look strange because it is rarely written. And we cannot interpret m · 3 (or 3 · m) to mean ""m groups of 3"", because m is not an integer. 
* Similarly, multiplication of a scalar c with a vector *v* is written as c*v*, not *v*c. 

However, I do have some points against it being an error:

* Peano arithmetic actually defines it the other way round. The axioms of multiplication are:
   * a · 0 = 0
   * a · S(b) = a + (a · b)
* Expanding the two axioms above, along with the commutative and identity laws of addition, give a · b = a + ... + a (b times). 
* The definition of ""n groups of m"" is arbitrary and conventional, and not a law of mathematics. Many people remember it as ""n, m times"", and this gives rise to the sum of n + ... + n (m times). 
* This definition is not easily extendable. For example, in working out the area of a rectangle, we can't interpret length x width as ""length copies of width"", because area isn't a discrete thing and there is nothing inherently special about one unit area, even if we limit the lengths to be integer values. 
* Multiplication being commutative can be taken for granted in some branches of mathematics. Taking the example of the area of a rectangle again, there is not much different between its length and width, because a relabelling of the axes reverses the terms. Here I guess you can geometrically interpret the commutativity of multiplication as: rotating a rectangle by a quarter turn doesn't change its area. There are probably some better examples I can't think of right now. 

Ultimately, I think a lot of confusion comes from multiplication of integers being, or happening to be, commutative, and I think there would be less errors/""errors"" if multiplication wasn't commutative.",math

,,"Math ""games"" for 4th/5th graders",scrumbly,1618871003,"Hi,

I've volunteered to lead an activity in my kids' grade 4/5 class. I have 45 minutes, it's over Zoom, and the topic is entirely up to me — my plan is to play some math games. One thought is to teach them the game 24 (i.e., combine 4 numbers with standard mathematical operators to total 24) and play that for a while. But 45 minutes of just that may be too long so I'm interested in some other fun math activities that would work for a group of ~25 kids. Any suggestions?

I've also thought about something like: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guess_2/3_of_the_average
Perhaps there are other variations on this that could be fun, like naming the smallest unique integer in a range?

Also, any thoughts on how best to play a game like 24 over Zoom with a large group? Main question for me is how to deal with timing. I'm thinking maybe a few kids at a time. Perhaps break them into three teams and each team sends one kid at a time to race to answer first.

All suggestions are welcome!",math
,,How To Calculate Without Data?,DoubleAddendum7636,1618869088,"So let's say you are finding out a ""likely"" financial data of a private company with limited data. How would you calculate the probability of an outcome e.g. Sales revenue in a period of time.  


You only have 3 variables with data  


Variable 1: 3 Different Product price  
Variable 2: Numbers of sales (without data which sales come from which product price in variable 1)  
Variable 3: X amount of numbers of sales will buy an upsell (a sale after the initial purchase)  


My question is; how would you ""predict"" the value of an activity and which predictive model to use? What are some of the search terms I can find online to predict/calculate outcomes?

,,Why is proof-based math not taught in elementary/high school curriculum?,Chrispy3,1618868642,"As a math major in the US, my first introduction to proof based math was only once I got into math courses which only math majors take. But this is where I really fell in love with math, it’s where I feel I really started to understand math and what I was actually doing. 

I totally understand the people who feel math is boring, not creative or interesting etc. The math they were taught wasn’t, and it wasn’t representative of what math is really like. 

By the time you’re 18-19 in the US, you’ve taken more than a decade of math classes. You’ve probably taken basic math, algebra, trig, calculus. All these classes are not that interesting in my opinion, they are all sort of algorithmic which lends itself to learning without understanding. For example, you see a particular problem with numbers and variables. You learn a series of sort of general steps that can be taken somewhat blindly and produces an answer. 

Proof-based math is entirely different. There is no algorithmic process you can memorize to complete a proof. Each proof requires a deeper understanding, and often a creative approach. 

Sometimes you come across a proof so simple and so elegant it inspires a kind of awe at its beauty, much the same kind of awe as a beautiful scene in nature or a painting. 

And I don’t see why this should be out of grasp for a typical high school student. There are many simple, elegant proofs that demonstrate important mathematical concepts that are easily understood, such as the proof of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, or of the infinitude of the primes. 

And it seems like a basic understanding of this gives an important conceptual understanding for the context of math. To learn a series of memorizable steps to compute something a calculator could do for you seems less useful than gaining an understanding of the nature of math, that it is explicitly a logical system built up from axioms by proofs. Or at least some sense of the logical rules which math depends on. 

I just happened to take a proof-based math class out of interest on the side, and I discovered something so beautiful. Had I not done that on a whim, I wouldn’t have known how interesting math is, and wouldn’t be a math major. So it seems like not offering at least some sampling of that material to general ed students is a disservice.",math

,,Sign function that returns only 0 and 1?,AinsleyBoy,1618856362,"honestly, I've always found an alternate sign(x) function much more useful. Instead of:

x&lt;0  ➜ (-1)

x&gt;0  ➜ 1

x=0  ➜ 0

It goes:

x&lt;0  ➜ 0

x&gt;=0  ➜ 1

And the form I've described it in is:

f(x) = sign(sign(x)+1)

A similar and equally useful function is the same, but with point 0 being equal to 0. This can be achieved with: 

g(x) = f(x) - f(-|x|)

And another similar function returns the original x if the value is over 0, and can be achieved easily with:

h(x) = x\*f(x)

I know you could easily create piecewise functions of these, but I just like creating them regularly as a novelty.

&amp;#x200B;

As a person that likes graphing and creating cool looking functions for fun, I just feel like it's much more useful. I'm not trying to replace sign(x) (considering I made the function with sign(x) it'd be a bad idea), but I just think it should at least have a name, so I don't have to type it into Desmos over and over again all the time, haha. I just wanna hear opinions about it, because I haven't really shared it with anyone and maybe it's all really stupid and I'm just not aware. So tell me what you think.

I understand that the discrete topology has at its most basic open sets singletons. I also understand how the topology itself consists of the power set of the given set. 

However, I was confused on how this discreteness the singletons have being in their own subset in the topology contrasts with the fact that the other subsets in the discrete topology have other points in there with it in the open set so they are not “discrete” in a sense as they are in the same larger neighborhood of one of the open sets in the topology.

As a simple example: X={a,b,c}

The discrete topology{{a},{b},{c}, {a,b}, {a, c}, {b,c},null set, X}

How does {a} being by itself contrast with it also being not by itself and “discrete “ if it’s also part of {a, b} in this same topology?",math

If you have an interest in mathematics and backing out mathematical profit margin to determine your edge over the sportsbook, then this may be a) interesting and b) make you some money. The sports betting market is a real market (just like stocks &amp; options), but what's great about it is the fact that it is so inefficient. MGM, Fanduel, DraftKings all have different odds, and often [arbitrage](https://ibb.co/WsMdqtr) opportunities exist where you can just bet both sides and make risk-free money. They are very new, very inefficient markets.

You can read about the math of this sort of stuff [online](https://oddsjam.com/blog). As an example, Fanduel offers a ""risk free"" bet of $1000 to new users who sign up. If you lose your first bet of 1k, you get your money back (so you have no downside). What's the expected value of this $1k risk free bet? If you bet something with a +100 payout, the fair win rate is 50% (1:1), so the expected value of your bet is $1000 x 0.5 + $0 x 0.5 = $500. If you bet something with a 2:1 payout, that implies the fair win rate is 1/3 - so the expected value of your bet = $2000 x 1/3 = $667. This implies that betting your risk-free bets on ""long shots"" is mathematically more profitable. There's a lot of cool tricks like this that you can use to make more money on these sign up promos and maximize your expected value. It's all basic probability and expected value, but still pretty interesting.

On top of that, there are tons and tons of [sign up bonuses](https://oddsjam.com/blog/posts/risk-free-betting-arbitrage-with-sign-up-bonuses). 12.5k total. Worst case you can do these and run. Disclaimer, I wrote some of the blog posts!",math

A long time ago, I read something somewhere about a curve on a graph that describes the gradually smaller impact of coaching or support on the outcomes of a group. So, I forget the specific context but it was to do with the idea that if you had a class of students and some were on track to get D grades and some were on track to get B grades then the impact of coaching the D grade students will be greater because they have a larger space in which to make the improvements required. 

Essentially this graph was showing that efforts are better spent working on a weakness or a weaker subject than one that is already proficient purely based on the principal that they physically have more to improve on and act on. 

Please help me remember this concept or theory! I hope I have chosen the correct space in which to ask this question. It’s driving me insane!

They were used to discriminate against Jewish students in the 70s and 80s.",saccpam,1618765521,"&gt;The Mathematics Department of Moscow State University, the most prestigious mathematics school in Russia, had at that time been actively trying to keep Jewish students (and other ""undesirables"") from enrolling in the department. One of the methods they used for doing this was to give the unwanted students a different set of problems on their oral exam. These problems were carefully designed to have elementary solutions (so that the Department could avoid scandals) that were nearly impossible to find. Any student who failed to answer could be easily rejected, so this system was an effective method of controlling admissions. These kinds of math problems were informally referred to as ""coffins"". ""Coffins"" is the literal translation from Russian; in English these problems are sometimes called ""killer"" problems.

,,Why is the (converse) of the basic proportionality theorem always true? 🤔,deostroll,1618725590,"It is silly to be discussing about the basic proportionality theorem in this century. Today, we use it to teach children how to construct a line segment and divide it in a certain proportion.

But a few years ago, I revisited the proofs I learned during school. And I was not quite satisfied with how we arrive at the conclusion, mainly because the style of converse proof is a proof by contradiction rather than rigor.

The contradiction-proof does not lend it self to answer the question: _why does a line parallel to the a side divide the other two sides of a triangle in the same proportion_? 

Or alternatively, _why does a line through the midpoint of one side of a triangle parallel to one side pass exactly through the midpoint of the 3rd side_?

This caught my curiosity for a while. The short answer is that ""that is just an interesting general property of triangles in geometry"". The long answer may perhaps be arrived at by the following the steps:

1. Applying the sine law...
2. Asking why the sine law is always true.

Not going to post the sine law proof here. There are probably other ways to prove it. But this insight into a fundamental nature of triangles made my day a long time ago. Just thought I share it.

,,What makes a good system of classification?,PaboBormot,1618718909,"**Motivation:**

So like this was motivated from myself thinking about psychological tests, like the MBTI or the Ayurvedic elemental system if you’ve heard of that. Now these systems are kinda seen as a meme by most, but I propose there is still a way to quantify how useful they are on a personal level as models to characterise and understand people 

**Details:**
So I propose one of the most important criterion is **obviously correctness** - in the sense that given that you know someone well enough, it becomes blindingly obvious (to you) that they’re in one of the categories, *and* your guess matches the result they get on the test.

So, for concreteness sake, let’s take three systems of classification - the astrology signs, MBTI, and Ayurvedic elements. Focus on one individual, who has a certain MBTI type, say. Now ask yourself - for each of the 16 MBTI types, how likely do you believe this individual is to be each of them? Of course the probabilities, or “likelihoods” should add up to 1. 

Now again the “obvious” part of the criterion says that a system of classification should score well well if it’s extremely obvious to you that someone is a certain type. The best tool for me to quantify this seems to be [entropy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy), specifically in the sense of information theory. So we compute the entropy of the probability distribution you assign to the person, and a necessary condition for a “good” test is for the entropy to be as low as possible on average. Let me informally justify this with some examples in the next paragraph:

In the case of maximal entropy, in other words your assigned probability distribution is the uniform distribution - you’re basically guessing completely at random each time. This does not a good system of classification make. In the case of minimal entropy, your distribution is 100% on a single option each time - the perfect system of classification.

So naively, we just try to classify a bunch of people, and then compute the average entropy. But this can’t be the whole story. Imagine you had someone who was completely certain of the astrology sign of any person each time... but they’re just wrong most of the time. More specifically they’re only right to the same degree that a completely random guess would be right. On the other hand if they were to be able to guess the astrology sign right every time with 100% accuracy, they must be some kind of supernatural oracle, and clearly astrology works for them - “works” may be the understatement of the year in this case.


That said, I’m having trouble actually figuring out the best way to incorporate this aspect of it; i.e. the “correctness” part of the “obviously correctness” criterion. I have a few preliminary ideas, but I wanted to know what others could come up with.",math

It's occurred to me that you could calculate the ""distance"" between the two graphs as an optimal transport problem: imagine you can move edge mass around the path structure of the graph and the amount of ""work"" you do is the amount of edge mass weighted by the number of steps on the walk.

We could say that the distance from G to H is the minimal amount of work required to turn G into H. Said differently, what is the most efficient way to move edge-mass around the network to turn G into H.

,,Which terms in mathematics do you consider overloaded?,IanisVasilev,1618698513,"By ""overloaded"" I mean a term that is used in different contexts with little to no relationship between its different uses. For example, I do not really consider the term ""vector"" overloaded because most of its uses are very related:

* A bound vector in Euclidean geometry is defined as a pointed segment.
* A free vector in Euclidean geometry is defined as an equivalence class of bound vectors that are translations of each other.
* Row-vectors and column-vectors in matrix theory are special types of matrices.
* A tuple of complex numbers is sometimes called a vector.
* A (1, 0)-tensor in differential geometry can be used as a definition for a vector in the tangent space.
* An element of a vector space (which includes the last four points as special cases) is often simply referred to as a vector.

Some examples of what I consider to be unrelated or unintentionally related uses:

## Spectrum

* The spectrum of a linear operator `[; T ;]` is defined as the set of scalars `[; \lambda ;]` for which `[; T - \lambda I ;]` is not invertible.
* The spectrum of a ring is defined as the set of its prime ideals.
* The power spectrum of a stationary stochastic process is defined as the Fourier transform of its autocovariance function `[; t \mapsto E(X_0 X_t) ;]` (or the discrete Fourier transform if the process is supported on the integers), given that the integral converges.

I only included terms I am familiar with. More uses are listed [here](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/70522/what-is-the-relationship-amongst-all-the-different-kinds-of-spectra).

## Kernel

* The kernel of a group `[; G ;]` is defined as the ""zero locus"" `[; f^{-1}(e_G) ;]` of a group homomorphism `[; f: H \to G ;]`. More abstractly, kernels in categories are equalizers of a morphism `[; f: A \to B ;]` and the corresponding zero morphism `[; 0_{A,B} ;]` (if the zero morphism and equalizer exist).
* A kernel function is synonymous with a function from `[; \mathbb{R}^2 ;]` to `[; \mathbb{R} ;]`. A better definition may exist, I don't know. These are used to define the function `[; g(y) = \int_{\mathbb{R}} f(x) K(x, y) dx ;]` as an ""kernel transformation"" of `[; f ;]` in analysis and statistics.

## Field

* Fields in algebra, i.e. commutative division rings.
* Fields in mathematical physics and related areas, i.e. either vector fields, defined as vector-valued real functions, or scalar fields, defined as scalar-valued functions.",math

,,Can it be proved that all the natural numbers can act as the centre between at least any 2 primes??,SnooRobots6923,1618639261,"For example, if we have a number: x, which has some prime-factorization.
Now, if we add and subtract a particular number: a, x+a, x-a, such that it creates a pair, with x at the centre I.e. a number between the 2 pairs. 
So, a should not be a prime factor from the prime-factorization of x, otherwise that gives us a composite number.
Also, a should not be a remainder of any of the primes that come wrt x, to give x+a and x-a as primes.
For example: 54 = 2×3×3×3. Therefore, 3 cancels out. Also, 'a' should be a value, that other primes that come till 54 - 2,3,5 and 7, don't have their multiples, I.e. 54+a 54-a = prime.
As, 54 is not divisible by neither 5 nor 7, a can be 7×5.
54+35=89, 54-35=19. 
Thus, 54 is the centre for these primes - 19,89.

,,Will these two series ever merge?,gaufowl,1618596412,"Define f(x) as:

if x is prime, f(x)=2x

else, f(x)=x-3

From some starting number x, we can form a series of numbers by creating a list where an element is f(x) of the previous element.

Examples:

86-&gt;83-&gt;166-&gt;163-&gt;326

3-&gt;6-&gt;3

1501-&gt;1498-&gt;1495-&gt;1492-&gt;1489-&gt;2978

After playing around with this it for a bit, there's a few rules I've noticed:

1. Anything that is a multiple of 3 is part of a decreasing series of numbers. This is because a multiple of 3 (besides 3 itself) is clearly not prime, so subtracting 3 will just get you to the next multiple of 3, which also won't be prime unless it is 3. Then because 3 is prime, it doubles to 6, which then forms a loop back to 3. 18-&gt;15-&gt;12-&gt;9-&gt;6-&gt;3-&gt;6-&gt;3-&gt;6 etc.
2. Also, I know that for an x&gt;4 and not a multiple of 3 will form an ever-increasing series. This is because a non-3 multiple will be congruent to 1 or 2 mod 3. An operation performed on a number that is 1 or 2 mod 3 will either lead to the same modular result when you subtract 3, or the modular result will flip from 1 to 2 or from 2 to 1 when you have a prime and f(x) calls for a doubling.
3. The series starting with 2 will give 2-&gt;4-&gt;1-&gt;-2 and then after this it's just a series of negative numbers racing away from the origin, though I don't really care about this. I'm more interested in the positive increasing series.

Starting at 8, the process with yield: 8-&gt;5-&gt;10-&gt;7-&gt;14-&gt;11-&gt;22 etc.

Starting at 16, the process yields: 16-&gt;13-&gt;26-&gt;23-&gt;46 etc.

If I wanted to continue the series starting at 8, you would see that the series eventually also reaches 46, and then after that the 8 and 16 series are both identical, which I refer to in the title of this post as ""merging"".

My question is, does the 8 series ever merge with the 20 series? I'm not sure how I would go about proving that they don't, but I also can't show that they do. I wrote a python script to try and find a number that they merge at, but I'm getting very large numbers and it's taking a while. I made a prime sieve that finds the first 11,078,937 primes, meaning I can check if numbers are prime up to the square of the largest prime in my list which is 199,999,991\^2 which is just shy of 40 quintillion. The largest numbers in the 8 and 20 series I reached are 43,799,019,719,940,094 and 25,958,023,050,897,814 respectively. I'd need to generate more primes to go any further but it's getting pretty exhaustive. 

Anyone know how to show that the two series do or don't merge?",math

The only thing I got was that we are now dealing with [two systems of equations/diffeomorphisms](https://i.redd.it/cw9bp6kq7ft61.png)

Where k=1,...,n and 𝛼=1,...,m and of course 𝑥∈ℝ^𝑛 and 𝑢∈ℝ^𝑚

Of course 𝜉 and 𝜂 are the coordinates of the corresponding IFG

This is where I got lost

We then define a manifold (𝑥,𝑢,∂𝑢,...,∂^𝑟 𝑢)

This will get us a system of equations:

𝑅^𝜎 (𝑥,𝑢,∂𝑢,...,∂^𝑟 𝑢)=0

For 𝜎=1,...,s

We are then creating a one-parameter group {𝐺𝛼} which is the set of those two systems of equations and is admitted to this 𝑅^𝜎 (𝑥,𝑢,∂𝑢,...,∂𝑟𝑢)=0 thing if it maps each solution of that into some other solution of this system

It continues that 𝑅^𝜎 (𝑥,𝑢,∂𝑢,...,∂𝑟𝑢)=0 implies for sufficiently small a that 𝑅^𝜎 (𝑥¯,𝑢¯,∂𝑢¯,...,∂^𝑟 𝑢¯)=0

Then we start talking about the Galilei Group, we go talking about the Theory of Prolongations and end on the Criterion of invariance &amp; Splitting of defining equations

Because the script is in English I could send it to anyone interested here, it's a longer read but I really don't understand anything of it. I simply don't see the motivation, interpretation and intuition behind all of that, and what it still has got to do with ""Solving ODEs with the Symmetry Methods""

Do you maybe know where I could inform myself better about it? Like which book/PDF/Youtube Videos/etc would you recommend?

So I thought, what if you created a program which scraps odds information from a lot of sports betting agencies on the internet, in real time and you, put that information through a program which takes Σ(1/X) of odds then priorities those with &lt;1. Then simply you adopt a betting strategy to attain long term profits.

Mathematically, what would this final betting strategy have to look like. Further, more tangibly, does anyone think this is feasible?",math

,,Can't decide College Major,Legitimate-Ahole,1618474366,"
Hello,
I'm in the final year of high school and I'm considering a degree in Mathematics at the Undergraduate level. I'll have to declare my major outright as universities in Pakistan don't let you change your major over the course of your college education. Now I'm thinking of doing mainly two things that I cannot decide between after my undergraduate:
1. Financial analyst/advisor
2. Data Analyst
Initially when I made up my mind about mathematics, I was attracted by the universality of the subject and how you can pivot to many other fields such as business or research. 
Now the problem is that I feel like I would be behind a person who has done their bachelor's in economics/finance if we're both applying for the job of a financial analyst in a firm. 
Should I just choose a major now? 
If I do go forward with a Mathematics degree, what steps will I have to take after my undergrad to build a career in the following fields?
1. Data Analyst/Statstician 
2. Research 
3. Financial advisor
4. Actuary 
5. Cryptography/security
6. Data Scientist
7. Financial Analyst

What I do know for sure is that Newcastle Uni is [restructuring the uni](https://www.newcastleherald.com.au/story/7189117/university-of-newcastle-schools-to-cut-75-jobs/). So the news isn't unexpected.

More of the slow trend in Oz that has been speed up by the pandemic.

The gov here (think Trump minus the jingoism) has stuffed the vaccination program and as a consequence is talking about keeping borders closed through out the rest of the year and into next year.

This means that another years worth (possibly two) of international uni students wont enroll at Oz uni's. Because of the lack of gov funding this will likely mean even more lay off may come as, according to rumor, uni's changed budgets to reflect only two years (rather than four) of a lack of international student enrollments. Even if budgets arn't too badly effected VC's will no doubt use this as an excuse to apply more pressure.",math

I can't find any discussion on this observation. I've tried to do some research into generalizations of the normal distribution to see if there's any way to connect e.g. generalized hyperbolic distributions to the axioms of free distributive lattices, but I quickly found myself out of my depth with Bessel functions, complex analysis, and the ridiculously long formulas involved. That said, the fact that Gamma functions, factorials, and other combinatoric-sy things like k!(n+k)! show up in the definitions of Bessel functions looks promising, and I also feel like there is a very hard to articulate intuitive connection between modes of vibration and the conjugate classes of downsets/antichains that give free distributive lattices their internal complexity.

Are there any resources to help understand Bessel functions and generalized hyperbolic distributions from the bottom up? Trying my usual top-down approach to new concepts is kinda failing because a) there are so many things named after people (Laplace's equation, Lévy processes, Newmann functions) that lead to their own rabbit holes of unknown relevance and b) it really seems to be a topic where concepts were built on concepts built on concepts to the point that the reason some part of an equation is formulated the way it is is long forgotten (or at least seldom if ever mentioned).",math

,,"What are some jobs that use any amount of advanced math/physics/computer science, or involve research, and how would one go about getting them, specifically?",MegaGenius,1618421845,"First off, my apologies if this violates rule 3, but I looked at the megathread, and it seemed like mostly for people still in school, which is not my current situation. 

So, I know there have been many, many questions and threads about this on this sub before, and I've seen a mixed bag of answers. Some people saying it's impossible to get a job that involves pure math, and that they're now a software developer and use no math at all. Some people actually recommend certain fields or topics that they work in that could be relevant. 

As for me, I have a Bachelor's in Math and Physics (double major). However, my studies have leaned much more towards math. I also know programming, and took a decent number of Computer Science classes. Probably enough to be a minor, but my school didn't offer the option to do a double major and a minor too. 

Right now, my goal is to find a job doing some kind of research. It doesn't have to be pure math, but I'm not the biggest fan of data science honestly, but it also seems to be a diverse field, so I could still be sold on it potentially. 

My primary topics are Abstract Algebra and Logic, which kind of screams Computer Science from what I've found so far. And I have taken classes in Algorithms, Discrete Math, AI, and Theory of Computation (Finite Automata, Turing Machines, Complexity Theory, and the like). And I enjoyed Theory of Computation especially, and I'd love to work in something like that, but I'm not sure how to go about finding a job in something like that. 

So this brings me to my main question: for any job or field that you recommend, how do I actually go about getting into it? I've found people saying things like going into Programming Language Theory, or doing Function Programming uses some similar skills to Abstract Algebra, and recommending them. 

But right now, I'm not sure of many other ways to look for jobs other than going on job sites and searching terms. Searching ""Computer Science"" gives me mostly programming type jobs. Searching ""Theoretical Computer Science"" turns up very little, almost none of which is relevant. Same story for searching any other vague topic or field that anyone recommends. 

That said, I'm not completely set on doing some kind of Computer Science research if anyone has any other recommendations. 

As of right now, finding a job that I can actually care about is one of the most important things to me. I know some people view their job as something they have to do, and can hopefully tolerate, so they can make money, and spend the rest of their time doing what they actually want to do, and there's nothing wrong with that viewpoint, but it's not how I view things at all. So be honest. If you think getting a job that fits what I'm looking for is a pipe dream, how do I go about fitting into that pipe? If you truly think it's impossible, then what are the best alternatives (Though I'm not sure I really believe it's impossible at all)?

A few of the most interesting jobs that I've found require a PhD. To be honest, I'm sort of burned out on school, but I think I'd rather get a PhD than work in a field I'm not really interested in. One of the main reasons that I didn't go for one, is because one my professors told me that a PhD would qualify me for a very narrow set of jobs, so if I wasn't really enthusiastic about academia, it probably wasn't the best choice. But based on my research, that doesn't seem to be the case, as it seems to open up quite a lot of options. Maybe things have changed since he was getting his PhD, though it's not like he was particular old or anything, so I'm not sure. So if you think my best choice is to go for a PhD, you can tell me that too. 

I'm also not hard ruling out any organization or anything. I've seen similar posts to this with people saying they didn't really want to work for the government, but I have no such reservations. In fact, I've applied for a Mathematician position at the NSA, which seems like it could be really cool if it works out, but it's currently my only ongoing job application, and I don't want to put all my eggs in one basket really. 

I'm also hesitant to get on a path that seems like it would take an extremely long time to get me to where I want. This is one of the main reservations I have about academia, is that, maybe in like 10 or 15 years (maybe!) it could put me in a pretty nice spot, but it could take even longer, and that's if it worked out at all. I barely even remember what was going on 10 years ago, so that essentially seems like an eternity to me, so I can't really get all that excited about something that far off. 

I also found some interesting physics research positions at NASA that didn't require a PhD, but they had a similar issue as well. They required very specific experience that could most likely only be obtained at NASA in a lower position, and the lower position did as well. So it seems like I'd have to start with an internship there, and slowly work my way up until I get to one of the cooler positions. And it seems like a somewhat railroaded path to me. NASA seems cool and all, but I'm not so passionate about it that I'm sure I'd really want to commit to it like that at this point. 

I'm not going to rule out slower paths entirely, but they're less than optimal for me I would say.

The number of permutations you can make with n digits and any r is floor(e\*n!)  
The number of combinations you can make with m digits is 2\^n

therefore, the equivalent combination strength to a permutation lock of length n is ln(floor(e\*n!))/ln(2)  


I don't know about you, but I would presume that the strength difference between a permutation and combination lock would rise very quickly (maybe exponentially?), but it actually doesn't. the ln(2) doesn't affect growth, so it grows like ln(n!) + ln(e), and the ln(e) doesn't affect growth so it growth like ln(n!). You can find its growth rate by considering that

ln(n!) = ln(n\*n-1\*n-2...) = ln(n) + ln(n-1) + ln(n-2)... =  Σln(r) from 2 to n, which is O(n\*ln(n)), not even quadratic.",math

I recall my professor presenting a theorem, and after mulling it over a bit, I asked some question that he said he'd need to get back to me about. The next class, he clarified that the theorem requires a region to be simply connected, which apparently resolved my concern.

I actually couldn't remember what theorem it was, but as I've been reviewing the material, I saw the requirement of a simply connected region for Green's theorem, and figured that must have been it. The reason this scene stuck out in my mind was more about his description of simply connected spaces. I had taken general topology prior to this, so I think the term was familiar, but we had discussed it in such an abstract way that I got angry at my topology professor for never mentioning the lasso analogy.

And since there was no prior discussion to the nature of the region, I probably wasn't thinking about anything more exotic than a region in the plane. Moreover, I'm fairly sure he did mention that the curve must be simple, so I wasn't picturing something like a figure 8. But now I'm stuck because I think those criteria just forced the region to be simply connected. Any ideas?",math

,,Is there a link between euclidean space and hyperbolic space?,_kenio,1618001285,"I was researching the poincare disc modell and all I could find was ways to calculate the distance between to points on the disc or how to create straigth lines on the disc (circle arcs) but nothing to the mapping of one plane onto the other. 

My question: Is there a way to take any point on the euclidean plane and find a point on the disc while straight lines create a circle arc perpendicular to the boundary of the circle? I know there is probably not a definit answer (when one even exists) to this but is there anyway we can do this? What I found was that when you take a straigth line on the disc (cicle arc) and map it onto a 3d-hyperboloid with a fixed point at (0,0,-1) (I think this is how the poincare disc modell is created) and then map it with a straight line parallel to the z-axis onto the x,y-plane you get hyperbolas.

Rota writes quite passionately (and humorously) about what needs to be changed about introductory diff-eq courses. 

Since I don't have too much experience with diff-eq's, neither pure nor applied (I only learned about them a bit in a real analysis course), I wanted to ask some people who migth have a bit more experience:

\- Have you seen a lot of (systems of) differential equations applied, i.e. in engineering, chemistry, physics etc., and if so: What things were extremely relevant, which no introductory course on diff-eq's covers (enough) and what things were never relevant in practice, despite making up a good portion of a standard course?

,,Does the definition of divergence of a vector field imply the existence of a still unknown type of integral?,Mirieste,1617999617,"As you all know, the idea of divergence of a vector field is a measure of how closely certain parts of the input space resemble sinks or sources: as a consequence, when a fluid is incompressible and no parts of it are destroyed or created out of nothing, its divergence is zero everywhere. And normally you would get the usual divergence formula by surrounding a point with a closed curve (or a surface in higher dimensions), then looking at the flow of the vector field through it in order to check ""how much"" fluid gets in and ""how much"" fluid gets out. As you shrink the line onto the point and take the limit, you can prove ([link](https://sites.google.com/site/butwhymath/calculus/divergence)) that what you get corresponds to what we usually define as the divergence of a vector field.

But I was thinking: wouldn't it be more natural to look at ***density*** instead? Let's remain on the plane, and let our closed curve be a square. Instead of looking at the flow of the fluid through its boundary, wouldn't the notion of compressible vs. incompressible fluid be explored much better if we looked at the ratio between ""how much"" fluid is *inside* the square and the area of said square? And then again, as you shrink the square and take the limit, this should approach the value of the divergence there (up to some normalizing factor at most).

But this is where I encountered an apparently insurmountable obstacle: **is the integral of a two-dimensional vector field over the interior of a square even defined?** As far as I know, given what I learned at uni, you can only integrate vector fields on lower-dimensional entities: for example, there are line integrals for two-dimensional fields; or surface integrals for three-dimensional fields—but is it possible to integrate a two dimensional vector field, say (x, y) ↦ (xy, x + 2y), over the unit square? Like, *inside* it?

So this is actually a two-part question:

* is it possible to integrate an n-dimensional vector field over an n-dimensional area, and how does it work?
* if the previous question can be answered positively, when taking the limit as the area shrinks down to a point, do we indeed get something that's equal, or at most proportional, to the divergence of the field at that point?",math

,,I created a proof assistant!,pirsquaresoareyou,1617997494,"As the title says, I created a proof assistant last month. I call it CORE, but I don't know what it stands for yet. I've always wanted to make something like this, but my 3 other attempts failed because my ideas weren't thought out well enough, so I'm super excited! Also, I haven't taken a logic class or even used a different proof assistant before, so my knowledge with proof theory is extremely limited.

Anyways, it's my own interpretation of propositional set theory with inspiration from the BHK interpretation. So far, I've been able to model ZF set theory and define some basic objects like functions and equivalence relations. I learned a lot in the process. For instance, I never realized that when we define an operation on sets, we either implicitly assume or have to explicitly prove that not only the result of such an operation exists, but that it's unique. For a while I was struggling to determine how I should implement such operations on sets, but I realized this and decided to make it only possible to define propositions (like `equal_sets` for when two sets are equal). Then, to define the union, I define when one set *is* the union of two other sets, then prove that such a set exists and is unique.

I figured that in making this language, I would end up re-implementing standard the standard features of popular proof assistants. I showed the language to someone who has used Coq and other proof assistants before, and they said that many concepts from the language were familiar but almost foreign. For example, in CORE, a proven statement with an existential quantifier can be used to ""construct"" an object satisfying the proposition. The object's lifetime and any information about that object is limited by the current scope the object lies in, so to my knowledge this should be consistent. Apparently, in Coq, a proposition like ""there exists X such that A(X)"" is used to prove that if ""for all X, A(X) implies P,"" then ""P"" is true.

Anyways, if anybody wants to take a look, the project is [here](https://github.com/been-jamming/CORE). I'm not sharing the project with the expectation that people will actually use it, but I am certainly still interested in making the language more powerful. So if you have criticisms please keep this in mind!",math

If the universe didn’t have consistent laws of physics, the universe would be a chaotic mess. Yet somehow maths maintains order. 

I also like how, using axioms, you can build up maths to new levels, so from set theory to group theory, group theory to abstract algebra etc. Maths is like a giant graph of nodes, each topic connecting to many others. We can use axioms to expand the number of objects in our graph.

Lastly, it seems really mystical when really deep and complex maths created by humans 100’s of years ago is found to describe the physical properties of the universe now. It makes me wonder what other secrets the universe is hiding, and how the universe came to existence. Could god be an alpha maths professor??",math

Long story short: I have a PhD in mathematics (dynamical systems / ODEs as main topic), and I am now doing a 1 year postdoc. I am not sure if academia is the right choice for me, but all the companies I've found which seem to be interested in people with my profile actually want programmers, or reeeeally applied mathematicians. Of course, learning Python would be an option; I know Matlab quite well, and I'm not 100% against coding. However, I'm a bit skeptical, since I'm afraid that would basically mean my job would consist mainly of coding, and I wouldn't want that.

So, my question is: are there European (or American, Asian etc.; I'm in Europe now, but if there are interesting options elsewhere I would apply as well) companies which *actually* hire mathematicians and not programmers? I only know of ThinkTankMaths in Edinburgh, to which I have applied during the last months of my PhD, but they didn't hire me; though that was almost one year ago, and I might try again in the future.

This is proving that the invariant distribution of the random scan Gibbs sampler has pi as its invariant.

I however want to calculate how close to a sphere the objects are. The easiest measure I could come up with is a comparison of the ratio of volume/(surface area) to that of a sphere of identical volume. Which is called sphericity and is apparently used in geology. A cube for example has a sphericity of 0.8 an ideal cone however as well.

Sphericity alone is hence not quite descriptive of how spherical an object is. A low sphericity can result from an elongated shape, or a sphere like shape with lots of crevices which increase the surface area. I hence want to use either an additional metric. Namely a measure for the roundness of a 3d object. Or an improved metric. Once thing i could imagine is some kind of average curvature, again compared to the curvature of a sphere of identical volume. How would you define such a measure?

For me, it was the thrill of solving problems, of being creative, and of discovering new things as I worked new, interesting problems. Some problems came from my teachers, some from questions I had while trying to make things (when I was first learning to code), and some because of thought experiments I had. I've always loved learning math and applying it to problems.

I started my undergrad and decided to major in Applied Mathematics (I'm sure some of you purists will say that THIS was the beginning of my troubles haha). Of course I loved calculus, linear algebra, etc. My transition to advanced Mathematics was also fantastic. My first proofs class is still my favorite class to this day, followed by real analysis.

Over the last couple of months, though, I've been feeling a change in the way I've been studying. While before, I used to take the time to understand and explore the concepts I was taught, and could easily get carried away for hours looking at a problem from different angles and experimenting with different techniques or proofs, lately I've been struggling to feel motivated to do my homework and I'll usually bust it out as fast as possible and only give 30% effort on the proofs. Sometimes I know the proof is wrong but I'll turn it in anyway. My grades have been suffering (granted, I'm getting Bs instead of As, but I know I can do better). I'm not taking the time anymore to explore, because I don't care as much as I used to.

I'm about to finish my Junior year. Currently taking both complex analysis and an optimization class (undergraduate level courses). I've known for a while that I want to go to grad school.

Can anyone else here relate to how I'm feeling? I know that deep down I still love Mathematics, but my passion for the subject has been waning. Maybe I'm burned out. How can I get out of this rut? How have you reignited your passion? What keeps you going?

This problem has been weighing me down since I went to college and now, being a Mcs student, it is at the worst it has ever been. I feel I'm almost about to collapse under it.

During high school I did practically nothing and didn't engage in mathematics in any form or shape. 99% of my time was spent programming and playing video games in an attempt to escape having to think about sitting idle in a classroom for 8 hours. When I went to college I enrolled in a CS bachelor specializing in cryptography and mathematics. Most of it wasn't very hard to understand, but right about enough pressure to keep me from disappearing into more escapism (basic linear algebra, basic calculus ,logic and basic statistics). I've also very much liked the concept of rigorous arguments and was very fond of logic, but never picked it up in any hobby I engaged in. I also developed a strong ambition to learn physics for I started to realize, arguably way too late, what marvelous applications it has. Remember that at this stage I had literally no formal background in it whatsoever.

The study took me a whopping 4,5 years (3 recommended, so 3 semesters late) years to complete, and at the late age of 24 I started my Mcs (now about a semester ago and I've turned 25 since). My Mcs was a midway between Electrical engineering, mechanics and computer science. It was given at a different university than the one I graduated at. I explicitly chose this for I had hoped I'd be able to tangentially pick up on physics , math and other engineering tools I had missed out on in previous years. Sadly I made the horrible mistake of spending a full semester trying to work my ass off doing courses that expected way more knowledge of me than I at the time possessed (or, worse yet, possess at this point). I learned I'm inadequate in all branches of mathematics: trig, linear algebra (or the study of manifolds and topology), electrical engineering, statistics, control theory, calculus etc. The only topic touched upon I felt comfortable with was logic. For all the others I simply didn't know the identities other students seem to readily recall, and as a consequence I fall behind on both work and intuition.

Right now I'm in this limbo where on the one side I want to engage in the math and the physics, but on the other hand every attempt I make at trying to learn is punished by failure (because the discrepancy in knowledge between me and my peers is so vast I'm about twice as slow getting work done - which in turn makes me even slower by virtue of demotivation). I'm forcing myself to watch every math related topic that pops up in my feed, and read every article referred to by topics I'm proactively searching for. But I hate every second of what I do, and it makes me feel miserable and inadequate. It's a very strange contrast between what I seemingly want and what my hormones are telling me what I want.

Is there anyone here who has experienced anything similar, and how did they manage to make life feel like worth living again? Should I give up on mathematics and focus on exclusively what I already know by virtue of my lack of knowledge? Should I quit studying in an attempt to find joy in the things I feel like I should feel joy in? Do I have to accept mediocrity?",math

We will now start with the reference of 1/3^s.

I will give S the value of 1

&amp;#x200B;

I have several questions regarding the way a number of the equations are expressed.

&amp;#x200B;

a1: (gk + 2g + k + 1)(h+j) + h - z = 0

Why is this not expressed as (g+1)(h+j)(k+2) - j - z = 0 ? It would make it simpler, and g could be reassigned the value of g+1, seeing as it is only used in this equation. Additionally, if h is reassigned the value of h+j, a1 might then be expressed as ghk - j -z = 0, with the provision that h&gt;j. a0 would then be wz + h - q = 0.

&amp;#x200B;

a6: 16(r\^2)(y\^4)((a\^2)-1) +1 - (u\^2) = 0

Why is (y\^4)((a\^2)-1) not expressed as (y\^2)((x\^2)-1), from a5?

&amp;#x200B;

a7: n + ℓ + v - y = 0

Why is this equation even necessary? Since it is entirely additive, v seems to be an arbitrary variable that does nothing more than add to n+ℓ in order to get y, and the equation itself doesn't seem restrictive in any way, as far as narrowing down the possible solution sets to the 14 equations is concerned, beyond establishing the fact that n+ℓ &lt; y.

&amp;#x200B;

α11-13:

p + ℓ(a - n - 1) + b(2an + 2a - (n\^2) - 2n - 2) - m = 0

q + y(a - p - 1) + s(2ap + 2a - (p\^2) - 2p - 2) - x = 0

z + ℓp(a - p) + t(2ap - (p\^2) - 1) - pm = 0

&amp;#x200B;

These could be much more attractively, if not necessarily more simply, expressed as 

ℓ(a - n - 1) - m + b((a - n - 1)\^2) - b((a\^2)-1) + 2bn + p = 0

y(a - p - 1) - x + s((a - p - 1)\^2) - s((a\^2) - 1) + 2sp + q = 0

ℓp(a - p) - mp + t((a-p)\^2) - t((a\^2) - 1) + z = 0

&amp;#x200B;

The entirety set of equations is then expressed as an inequality where 1 minus the sum of the squares of each equation, multiplied by k+2, is set as greater than 0. For any set of positive integers that make each of the 14 equations equal to 0 and that makes the inequality true, k+2 is supposed to be prime.

This seems very stupid to me. Given that the solution must be composed of positive integers, and presumably 26 different ones, then the inequality's use of the squares of the equations seems unnecessary. Additionally, why not just reassign to k the value k+2, and change k+2 to k in a1-2 and  k+1 to k-1 in a1, a2 and a9?

,,Can a jellyfish visit every point in the plane?,NawXD,1617661615,"I think I may have found an interesting problem, but it's more likely that it's simpler than I think and somebody already solved this at some point. Anyway, hope it's not the wrong place to post.  


Say you have a jellyfish sitting at (0,0) in the real plane (R\^2 or the set of all complex numbers, whatever you like). It can only move by ""jumping"" instantaneously a distance of 1 in any angle. So for example, from (0,0) it can go to (0,1) and from there it could go to ( √ 2/2, 1+ √ 2/2) and so on. It can't move a distance less or greater than 1. It must move a distance 1. I was able to prove it could visit any point in the plane, I won't write it here because maybe you'd like to solve that, I didn't think it was that hard. The jellyfish can actually visit any point by moving any distance \*d\*, as long as d is a real number and positive, being a distance and all.  


What I found more interesting is thinking of an exponential jellyfish. First moving distance 1, then 2, then 4, then 8, and so on. Although it was a bit harder, I found out it can visit any point in the plane as long as it is farther than 1 from the origin. And I think I can proove it cannot visit any point closer than 1 to the origin.   


As long as the sequence of steps (in this case 1, 2, 4, 8 ...) forms a divergent series, it can go to infinity and we can think about the jellyfish visiting the whole plane. If you had a convergent series, for example 1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, 1/32, ..., the Jellyfish wouldn't ever be able to get to the circumference of radius 2 or farther. Could it visit any point inside that circumference?  


For divergent series, how would you find out from any sequence of steps that forms a divergent series if it can or can't visit any point in the plane? If it can't, is it possible to prove which areas the jellyfish can't visit? What if the jellyfish wants to visit any point in the plane at any point in time? I think the exponential jellyfish I talked about earlier can't go back to (0,0) for example, but I haven't proved it. Also the proof I have that the exponential jellyfish can visit the whole plane, makes it so it cannot visit it in one go. There's a difference from visiting the whole plane to visiting any point starting from (0,0) and I proved that it could visit any point starting from (0,0). Not that it can visit any point at any time. I hope that makes sense  


So that's been in my mind for a while. I haven't been really succesful finding answers online and I'm not sure which area of math can help with this problem. You can also think about the most optimal path the jellyfish should take depending on the sequence, but that's to close to travelling salesman and all that for my taste. Hope it's fun to work this out and it isn't incorrect to post here. Feel free to tell me off for posting in the wrong place, and I hope this is understandable at least, english ain't my first language, but I'm rather confident with it.",math
,,Haircut math,maest,1617660907,"Last time I went to the barbers, it was right after the first set of Covid restrictions had been lifted. The barber was complaining that they had been working overtime for the past 2 days as people hadn't cut their hair in ages and there was a lot of pent up demand. Essentially, the entire city had synchronized their need for a haircut at the same time. I asked the barber if she was worried that the sync meant that there would be another peak a few weeks in, when everyone would be coming back for another haircut at the same time, but she didn't think that was the case.

Anyway, this made me think of the following:

Assume you have a population of N people (for a large N). Each person p wants to cut their hair every C(p) days, with C(p) having a normal distribution over N (with some mean and dev). Assume everyone starts off synced, so having a haircut on the same day. Also, assume people can always get a haircut on the day that they want.

Each person p is, then, a simple process that outputs 1 every C(p) days. Call this process the haircut process H(p). On day d, for person p, H(p,d) = 1 if the person is having a haircut or 0 otherwise.

Can you describe how the number of daily haircuts evolves over time? That is, the All Haircuts process AH = sum H(p) for all p in N. AH(d) shows returns how many people are getting their hair cut that day.

Roughly, I'd expect something like this:

* AH(0) = N, as on day 0 everyone is cutting their hair.
* On the interval 1 to some day d1, AH(d) = 0, as people have just cut their hair and have no need for haircuts.
* On the interval d1 to d2 AH(d) resembles the distribution of C(p) over N
* After d2 you have a series of peaks and through, but AH(d) will tend to N / avg(C(p) over N).

Are there more precise descriptions of the function AH?",math

My question is, at what point am I allowed to say that I am a mathematician? Already? After I graduate? After I publish my first paper? After I get a PhD? When I get a faculty position? (I know, I know, there are big ifs in all of those questions, but ignore this for now).
In my head, it seems very wrong to call myself (and also my peers that are graduating)  a mathematician, I don't know why. To me, Gauss is a mathematician, Mirzakhani is a mathematician, my Professors are mathematicians, and I am not like them. At the same time, I also view my high school math teacher as a mathematician, and he didn't have a PhD in math. Also, I would definitely call someone with a bachelor degree in engineering an engineer. So I don't know what to make of this. 
I know this is sort of a silly question, I am just posting this in hopes of hearing that others can relate to my thoughts. And I would hate for this to come off as elitist in any way - as in, someone has the right to call themselves a mathematician if they have at least x amount of accolades. I am just hoping to figure out exactly what it is that is preventing me from thinking of myself as a mathematician - even if this something is not rational in any way.",math

,,An interesting number system I came up with.,homestar_galloper,1617651759,"I thought of an interesting generalization of the integers, where you define each integer as being a set of prime-cyle placements.

for example:

\-Every integer is of the form (2n) or (2n+1)

\-Every integer is of the form (3n), (3n+1), or (3n+2)

\-Every Integer is of the form (5n), (5n+1), (5n+2), (5n+3), or (5n+4)

ect.

If you think of an ""integer"" as being the set of all of it's placements in all of these cycles, you can easily generalize that concept by allow any combination of placements.  For example, you could have a number that's exactly like zero in every way, except it's an odd number.

,,"Math, Overthinking and learning disabilities",costas_vitalie,1617651085,"Hi guys, 

I would like to get your opinion. 

Since I can remember I've always been someone who overthinks a lot but now I think I might have some sort of learning disability. 

This is why I think so: 

\- When I'm reading, a lot of the times, I have to read again and again to understand. It feels as I read the text without giving any sort of meaning. I have to read very slowly and picture in mind every word so I can understand. 

\- When I'm writing something I have to check multiple times. Sometimes I stop and without realising I start to read again everything, it feels like I lose track of what I'm thinking. 

\- I think like a perfectionist. I think again and again obsessively about the same thing with the ideal to get it perfect. 

\- Although I can focus on things if you can get to know me you will understand that sometimes 'I live in the clouds', I forget things and distract easily.

\- When I'm studying math, even though I understand the rules, at the same time it feels like I don't. I'll ask myself why continuously on some sort of step. And I think so much about it that it feels as I want it to be real. My obsessive questioning about everything limits my understanding.   
When I was in school, and we were studying a new topic, at the beginning of the lesson I was able to understand but later on, with more information, it felt so overwhelming because I want to know every single detail and too many questions. 

I would like to study maths and physics again, but because of the things I mentioned above I always feel doubtfully about my capabilities. 

I realised this with maths because it makes you think, but generally in life my overthinking has been limiting me in many other areas. 

I hope you understand what I mean. Let me know what you think.

Thank you so much for your help and understanding. 

P.S

,,Getting Started with Research,RandomAnon846728,1617650366,"Hi, I am currently an undergrad studying maths in the UK.  I have quickly fallen in love with pure maths as we have just finished our major courses for the year in group theory and real analysis.  

I’ve been thinking about possible futures into graduate studies, even though it might be a bit early.  

So I would like to know where to start.  From what I understand a phd candidate roughly knows what area of research, they want to go into or at least do some initial research projects whilst still in undergrad.  I’ve even heard stories about the need to be published in undergrad which seems pretty much impossible at the moment given my vast lack of knowledge.

How does one go about starting or even knowing what research area to go into.  Especially since the maths I see in journals I can access through the uni is quite frankly a different language.

My thoughts so far in maths:

- I really enjoyed real analysis, it’s rigour was genuinely enjoyable
- our introduction to group theory was fun, I liked the relationship with shapes and symmetries
- our probability theory course was interesting, it’s a much more expansive topic than I realised

So anyone got any hints, I need something to do this summer and finding a maths topic to research seems like a good idea.",math
,,Pretty Little Polly Nomial,masterofmisc,1617649743,"I Just found this on an old Amiga disk mag and it gave me a chuckle so thought id share it here!

Once upon a time (1/t) Pretty Little Polly Nomial was strolling across a field of vectors when she came to the boundary of a singularly large matrix.

Now Polly was convergent, and her mother had made it an absolute condition that she must never, enter an array without her brackets on. Polly, however, who had changed her variables that morning and was feeling particularly badly behaved, ignored this condition on the basis that it was insufficient, and made her way in amongst the complex elements.

Rows and columns closed in on her from all sides. Tangents approached her surface, and she became tenser and tenser until, quite suddenly, three branches of a hyperbola touched her at a single point. She oscillated violently, lost all sense of directrix, and went completely divergent.

As she reached a turning point, she tripped over a square root which was protruding from the erf and plunged headlong down a steep gradient. When she was differentiated once more, she found herself apparently alone in non-euclidean space.

She was being watched; that smooth operator, Curly Pi, was lurking inner product and as his eyes devoured her curvilinear coordinates, a singular expression crossed his face.

“Was she convergent?” he wondered.

He decided to integrate improperly at once.

Hearing a common fraction behind her, Polly turned around and saw Curly Pi approaching with his power series extrapolated. She could see at once by his degenerate conic and his dissipative terms that he was bent on no good.

“Eureka!” she gasped.

""Hey” he said, ""What a symmetric set of asymptotes you have!""

""Oh sir” she protested, ""keep away from me – I haven’t got any brackets on!""

""Calm yourself, my dear!"" said the suave operator, ""your fears are purely imaginary.""

""I, I” she thought, ""Perhaps he’s homogeneous.""

""What order are you?"" the brute suddenly demanded.

""Seventeen,"" replied Polly.

""I suppose you’ve never been operated on before?"" he leered.

""Of course not!” Polly cried indignantly. “I’m absolutely convergent!""

""Come on,"" said Curly: ""Let’s go to decimal place I know of, and I’ll take you to the limit.""

""Never!"" gasped Polly.

""Fortran!"" he swore using the most debase oath he knew.

Coshing her over the coefficient with a log until she was powerless, Curly removed her discontinuities. He stared at her significant places and began smoothing her points of inflection. Poor Polly Nomial!

The algorithm method was now her only hope. She felt him approaching her asymptotic limit. Her convergence would soon be gone forever.

There was no mercy; Curly was a heavy side operator. His radius squared itself and Polly’s loci quivered. He integrated by parts. He integrated by partial fractions. He even went all the way around and did a contour integration. Curly went on operating until he satisfied her hypotheses, then he exponentiated and became completely orthogonal.

When Polly got home that night, her mother noticed that she had been truncated in several places. But it was too late to differentiate now. As the months went by, Polly’s denominator increased monotonically.

Finally, she generated a small but pathological function that left surds all over the place and drove Polly to deviation.

The moral of this tale is: ""If you want your expressions to remain convergent, never allow them a single degree of freedom.""­

,,Discussion about a decentralised and distributed accurate timing system.,MarcusOrlyius,1617638477,"Last night, I was thinking about how cellular automata propogate by updating all states at some given event, for example, every second. This is a beat - a pulse - a cycle - a regularly recurring event. It's a timing event for a system. The second is defined based on hyperfine splitting, etc. The physical world is governed by such accurate timing events. This led me to what I consider to be a significant understanding.

When it comes to decentralsied and distributed systems such as blockchain platforms, these accurate timing systems don't exist from what I can tell and there's no way to measure time with significant accuracy.

It also seems to me that blockchains themselves could function as such timing systems with blocks playing the role of beats. For example, the goal for the bitcoin blockchain is to create a new block every 10 minutes. You could say that the blockchain has a pulse of 1 beat per 600 seconds on average. This kind of simulates a heartbeat - a timing system with a variable beat. It can speed up and slow down and ""resting"" will return it to normal. What these distributed systems need is a blockchain equivalent to a fixed rate timing system like hyperfine splitting as opposed to a variable one.

So, what I'm hoping to achieve with this post is to hopefully start a discussion about this subject. Is it possible to create a blockchain type system with incentives but with a fixed rate block creation?

Is such a system even necessary or could creating blocks more quickly have the same effects, for example, 1000 blocks per second instead of 1 block per 600 seconds? What are the limitiation, etc?",math

,,Is Godel's Incompleteness Theorem extremely specific to Formal Systems?,grumpy_youngMan,1617575133,"Hi - first time poster here. I hope this is relevant for this thread...

I've been independently studying Godel's incompleteness theorem and my main take away is that it's only specific to Formal Systems rather than this pie-in-the-sky philosophical concept about the nature of proving anything. 

For example, I can use Godel's incompleteness theorem to find contradictions in any formal system that tries to define the set of all provable statements or formulas. But I can't use Godel's incompleteness theorem to prove that using logic in general is inherently flawed because it's 'incomplete' or misses the subtlety of certain arguments (e.g. a philosophical debate).

Is this a gross oversimplification? Or have there been applications to Incompleteness Theorem outside of mathematical logic?",math
,,Are there any fields of math which computers can't do or understand?,burupie,1617567085,"I've been thinking lately, it seems like programming and math fit together really well. If you want to understand some mathematical object, you can model it in a programming language, and perform various operations on it, automatically, sparing yourself the tedium of handwriting out calculations and so on.

However - and this connection is tenuous, but I bring it up in case it sparks any potential relations - my understanding of Godel's Incompleteness Theorem is that Godel proved that all of mathematics cannot be derived from one set of universal axioms. It seems rather there are many mathematical systems arising from different starting ""primitives"", fundamental concepts defined in the field. It seems mathematics is a kind of cognitive activity based on precise rule-following and anything in cognition that lends itself to such precise rules, but it doesn't follow that all mathematics is part of one single system that follows from some universal foundational truths, i.e. logic or set theory. Not sure if I'm totally off the mark here, but it's my armchair rumination.

Anyway, I am also aware of some projects which I believe have tried to make math rigorously provable with computer programs. Is Homotopical Type Theory on such project?

In view of these notions, I wonder, are there any fields of mathematics, or objects, that cannot be modeled computationally, for some reason, because they somehow rely on human intuition which cannot be reduced to the logical operations a computer would need? I.e., something that appears true from the ""cognitive"" aspect of mathematics, but not the perfectly rigorous, logical, foundational, derivational aspect?

Maths has been my nemesis. Right up to the point, at 37, I said screw it and decided to do a part time BSc with the Open University. Now, 3 years in, I am enjoying it and wondering what I was so scored of. Maybe poor teachers?

The Question:

I have been doing some Python and Julia programming in my spare time (The last time I touched a computer for maths was C64 BASIC for simple sums) to explore mathematics. I have done some stuff on Collatz Conjecture. This was fun. Really fun. I also did some stuff with small Mersenne Prime numbers (I have seen the Numberphile vid on that monster prime and I am sure my laptop cried at the prospect of working it out.) So is there some other stuff where I can learn to use my computer to do the one thing that it was designed to do (its in the name PC) while exploring some really interesting mathematics?

I am open to all topics. Not limited to; Graph Theory (This looks really interesting \[Actually this looks really cool but I don't want to get picked on by the cool maths kids ;) \]), calculus, or anything else that people would think is cool. I also have some experience with C64 BASIC, Python and Julia so if anyone could recommend anything that (especially with the c64) produce some cool video effects I am all ears.",math

,,What would it mean to be 'good at math'?,zxcvber,1617550948,"I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I just wanted to talk about this.

My mother just said that 'being good at math is equivalent to being good at calculus'. Upon hearing this, I had to say something about it. As a student studying math (well actually my major is computer science and math is my minor), I wanted to assert that there are other branches of mathematics, and calculus is not everything.

I think it is necessary to explain why my mother said so. I'm a student in South Korea, and high school students learn elementary calculus. Although they learn other branches of mathematics such as probability theory or geometry (conics, vectors etc), a major part of Korean high-school math is actually (inevitably - due to the university entrance exams) calculus. So it seems that she thought: being good at math is being good at *the* major part of high school math, which is calculus.

So I tried to tell her that calculus isn't everything, there are other branches of mathematics such as discrete mathematics, algebra, etc. Then she suddenly asked me, ""Then, what is math? Tell me, you minor in math.""

As an undergraduate student and a student *minoring* in math, I felt unqualified to respond to that question, and I honestly said that I don't know. (Well, because of my response, she looked at me in a condescending way... I personally think she asked the wrong person. I'm only a student, not even majoring in math.) 

Then she also asked, ""What do you think 'being good at math' is?"" This question, I could answer. So I replied, ""Having the power to think logically and apply what one has learned.""

I know my answer is short-sighted. I'm no expert. But I was curious what other people might reply to my mother's question. What do you think? Any comments on my answer is always welcome. I would love to learn more.

&amp;#x200B;

Additionally, she wanted me to explain why calculus wasn't everything. She does know that Korean high school students do not only learn calculus. But she asserted that probability and statistics seemed like a totally different subject, to not even call it math. (Yes. She said that probability and stats are not math) To be honest, I got kind of mad at this point and stopped talking.

Even to me, probability and statistics seemed to use a lot of calculus, and I have heard that measure theory lies inside probability theory. (I also heard a lot about people fighting over whether stats is math or not, but let's put that aside here)

Moreover, I also got frustrated because I took a lot of math classes as an undergraduate but couldn't really explain why calculus wasn't everything. (Not being able to explain this clearly seemed to imply that I wasn't really understanding the subjects I took) How would one explain that math has a variety of branches, to a person who believes that calculus is the only math?

(Personally, if I were EVER to be in a situation where I had to explain such things, I would run far far away and avoid such situation...)

,,proof that 0.999... != 1,shaeinst,1617510332,"some days ago, i saw a proof for 0.999... = 1. 

so, here is a proof why 0.999... != 1.

# proof:

    0.1   x 10   = 1
    0.01  x 100  = 1
    0.001 x 1000 = 1
    ...
    0.&lt;n-1&gt;1 x 1&lt;n&gt; = 1
    
    also, 
    0.&lt;n-1&gt;1 x 1&lt;n&gt; = 0.&lt;n&gt;1 x 1&lt;n+1&gt; = 1  ------------equation(1)
    
    here, n = no. of zero(s)
    
    Example: if n = 5 then,
        0.&lt;5-1&gt; x 1&lt;5&gt; = 1
    or, 0.&lt;4&gt; x 1&lt;5&gt; = 1
    or, 0.0000 x 100000 = 1

we just discovered new method (i don't know if this already discovered ). now let's disprove 0.999... = 1

    given,     0.999... = 1 -----------------equation(2)   (though this is not equation)
    we can do,
        1 - 0.9   = 0.1
        1 - 0.99  = 0.01
        1 - 0.999 = 0.001
        ...
        1 - 0.&lt;x&gt;9 = 0.&lt;n&gt;1
    so, 0.&lt;n&gt;1 + 0.&lt;x&gt;9 = 1     ---------------equation(3)
    
    now, if equation(2) is true then, from equation(3), following also be must true
        0.&lt;n&gt;1 = 0
    multiplying both sides by 1&lt;n+1&gt;, we get
        0.&lt;n&gt;1 x 1&lt;n+1&gt; = 0 x 1&lt;n+1&gt; 
    or, 0.&lt;n&gt;1 x 1&lt;n+1&gt; = 0      ---------------equation(4)
    
    but from, equation(1), we know that
        0.&lt;n&gt;1 x 1&lt;n+1&gt; = 1
    
    hence, 0.999... != 1 proved

""A (p,q) Dehn surgery on a S^3 with a knotted torus removed is the manifold formed by gluing in a solid torus via a boundary homeomorphism that sends a meridian to a curve that wraps around the meridian p times and the longitude q times.  The homeomorphism type of the resulting manifold depends only on the knot the torus is tied into and the ratio p/q.""

Why is that last sentence true?  If we think of the boundary torus as ℝ^(2)/ℤ^(2) a meridian is the set of all points (a,0), and for any x,y such that px-qy=1 it is easy to show that (a,b)↦(pa+yb,qa+xb) is a homeomorphism of the torus.  This sends (a,0) to (pa,qa), which is a curve that wraps around the meridian p times and the longitude q times.  Coprime p and q will have infinitely many x,y that satisfy px-qy=1, and in general the various homeomorphisms from the different choices of x,y are not isotopic.  Why, then, do they form homeomorphic manifolds at the end of the day?

,,Would there be any interest in a post where we discuss (initially) unintuitive concepts in math?,PaboBormot,1617424811,"I’m thinking of writing a post that discusses mathematical concepts and objects that many people find unintuitive at first. I know for me, the biggest struggle I’ve faced while learning math is the question of why these definitions are the right ones to make. In the same vein, why we would expect a theorem to even be true. And especially with certain concepts, at least among the few math people I know, I find I’m by far not the only one. 

So I thought a post like this would help others who struggle with the same problem. I would start by writing a moderately detailed exposition on how I currently understand these concepts, and then we could discuss further in the comments. The focus of the main post and discussion should hopefully be about not just the properties/behaviour of the objects, but why the objects are the right ones to talk about in the first place. 

Of course I make no claims as to the originality of the stuff I might write - most, if not all of them have been gathered from scattered sources around the web and chewing on them for a bit. And I can’t guarantee that what I share will be a good way, or even a correct way to view things.

But they may spark some good discussion nonetheless, and it would benefit me greatly as well to have people to banter with, hopefully reinforcing good intuition and snuffing out bad ones.

So some of the things I had in mind, just off the top of my head are:

- Conditional expectation (of a random variable with respect to another RV/a sigma algebra)

- The exterior derivative

- Ultrafilters, and their relation to convolutions

- Weakly differentiable functions, i.e. Sobolev and bounded variation functions

So if any of this sounds appealing to anyone, let me know! If there’s enough interest I’ll be glad to open the discussion. Suggestions for other good concepts to discuss would be very welcome too.",math

,,Probability of success in r/second when guessing at random before any counts are revealed,SincereLeo,1617369912,"Reddit's April Fools joke asks you vote for the second most popular of three things. You can vote at the beginning, after votes counts have been revealed, or after vote counts have been revealed twice. If you vote at the beginning for the thing that gets the 2nd most votes, you get 9 points; if you vote unsuccessfully you get -3.

To me, this implies the assumption that the odds of randomly guessing ""correctly"" at the beginning of the game are 1/3, so if you guess randomly in many rounds, you'll average out at 0 points. But I'm wondering if this is a correct assumption, since future votes (after counts are revealed) are likely somewhat dependent on the votes at the beginning.

But I'm having trouble figuring out a way to model this mathematically! Anyone have thoughts?

An original well-known function is given by c(x) = if (x % 2 == 0) then x/2 else 3x + 1, but I've found a function c_{a1,.., an},m(x) = if (x % ai) then x/ai else m*x + 1. Doing it for all ai of course before the multiplication.

It however seems possible (but only verified with numbers under 108 from my part) that c{2,3},5(x), c{2,3,5},7(x), c{2,3,5,7,11},17(x) all behave the same way. I have not tried heavier computations, but I have to give this one up for now before I go mental.

I believe the problem is about reserving some prime factors and multiplying the rest and adding 1 to them which eventually will be transferred to the reserved prime factors.

I have not been able to find anything about this - many have been focusing on (m*x + c) % a instead of modding with several different numbers instead of their product.

So here my question:
When the air from the inlet, pushed by the centrifugal force diffuses, it slows down, because every second n mL of air traverse a section equal to 2*PI*r*h. In a nutshell, the further a molecule of air is from the center the slower I think it should move.
On the other hand, if a point of the blade is further from the center it will move faster, so the slope of the spiral should get closer to 0 further we go.
Let's take as an example the case of two points, one over the edge of the impeller (A) and the other half of the radius from the center (B). If the speed of the air is 2 at B it will be 1 at A (because the traversed section that is a cylinder doubles by doubling the radius). Now taking a point of the blade we have that its velocity at B is for example 1 and at A it must be 2. So the slope of the spiral must be 1 at B and 1/4 at A.
In general, I think I need a spiral of the form r=e^tan(k/r^2).
Does a spiral like this even exist?
Does this formula even has a meaning?
The problem is that I have ""r"" on both sides.
By the fact that I need a function in function of their slope I think we are talking about differential equations, aren't we?

,,Will using STD DEV to reject bad data cause a feedback loop to where boundaries shrink until only a single integer is accepted?,5kyl3r,1617306400,"I'll try to TD;DR as much as possible.

I move data with code from one source to a database.  The row count varies a bit for many factors that aren't important.  If half is missing or even completely empty, writing to table breaks things that rely on this data.

I decided to calculate and store standard population deviation (for that entire day) and store in historical table.  then the next day I use that standard deviation times a user adjustable coefficient, to set how far high/low the incoming data can be from the mean from the prior day.

I already did this and it's working great.

my question: since it's been rejecting bad data, the standard deviation is getting smaller.  that means my calculated acceptable boundaries are also shrinking.  will this cause some kind of bad negative feedback loop to where it shrinks until I only accepts a single integer and std dev is = 0?  if no, anything to consider with this method for rejecting bad data?  if yes, is there a ""best practice"" or elegant solution?

second part of the question; we have some data sources that give us the same row count every time and often doesn't change for weeks.  I realized if the value is the same each time, std dev would be zero.  the user adjustable coefficients won't matter if we're multiplying it by a std dev of 0.  that means upper/lower boundaries are going to equal the average value.  meaning only a single integer is accepted.  is there a good way to handle such cases?  my original idea was to just allow a certain percent deviation from the average row count, but I went with std dev as my brain saw it was the more fancy way of doing it.

,,Strategy for r/Second similar to Monty Hall problem,ThePeanoAxioms,1617305760,"Currently at r/Second there's an interesting game being played of trying to guess the 2nd most popular image out of 3 images. The game gives you 2 peeks into which image is currently winning at the cost of losing potential points. So without any peeks, guessing the right answer gives +9 points and wrong -3 points, after one peek, the points drop down to +6/-2 and after two peeks, +3/-1. I've been trying to develop a light strategy for how to play this game and the first one I've thought of is the Monty Hall problem.

So obviously if we randomly guess, the expected gain is 0 since there's a 1 in three chance to guess correctly. However after the first reveal there will always be a clear loser, without going into too much detail, it's pretty intuitive why nobody will continue to cast their vote for the very last option. I'm not a game theorist but there's probably some way to mathematically represent that. So if we know a certain option is the wrong why then by a similar logic to the Monty Hall problem we know one of the remaining options is the winner.

So under the admittedly naive assumption that no other information is revealed by the peeks, each of the two remaining options would have a 50/50 chance of being the 2nd most popular and thus the expected number of points per round would be .5(6)+.5(-2)=2.

So far I haven't been able to perfectly predict the game after the 2nd reveal, but according to some quick maths, if P(guessing correctly after 2nd reveal) &gt;.75 then the expected points will be better than randomly guess after the first reveal.

So a general strategy I developed based off that is if I can figure out what the most popular image is, I make a guess before the first reveal because the most popular image must be the loser. However if I'm unsure I wait for the first reveal before making a guess.

What are your strategies for this game and any ideas on developing this strategy further?",math

His answer was (I'll paraphrase) ""not really, you'll need to know alot of properties, it's not your level""

,,Nonzero residues of recurrence relations (gallery and Python program),neutrinoprism,1617233698,"[Link to the full gallery](https://imgur.com/a/o0fQwDX).  Python program below.

Hi everyone.  I recently submitted my master's thesis on multivariate recurrence relations and fractal patterns in the arrangements of their nonzero residues modulo a prime (and fractal-ish patterns w/r/t powers of primes).  I thought I'd share some fun pictures and the Python program I used to make them while I talked a bit about the topic.

The most famous example of this phenomenon is in the entries of Pascal's triangle modulo 2.  If you [color-code the entries of Pascal's triangle according to whether they're even or odd](http://larryriddle.agnesscott.org/ifs/siertri/Pascal.htm), you obtain a discrete version of the [Sierpinski triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpi%C5%84ski_triangle).  Doing so over 2^n rows approximates ""stage n"" in the construction of the Sierpinski triangle.  In the ""view from infinity"" the correspondence becomes exact.  (This can all be made rigorous.)

The entries of Pascal's triangle, namely [binomial coefficients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_coefficient), obey a famous recurrence relation as well.

Now imagine putting Pascal's triangle into a perpendicular arrangement — like a spreadsheet.  Nestle the top of the triangle in the upper left corner and arrange the proceeding rows diagonally like this *///*.  Then the recurrence relation, couched in terms of spreadsheet cells, becomes this: ""the value in this cell is the sum of the cell to the left and the cell above this one.""  (If that cell exists, of course. Disregard references to cells ""outside"" of the spreadsheet.)  We can symbolize that with a little matrix-like array with an asterisk representing the current cell:

    0 1
    1 *

What if we added a diagonal?  That is, what if we changed that zero to a one?

    1 1
    1 *

The array of numbers that results is called the [Delannoy numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delannoy_number).  They're all odd so they're not very interesting modulo 2, but, delightfully, their pattern of nonzero residues modulo 3 replicates the [Sierpinski carpet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpi%C5%84ski_carpet).

So this should give you an idea of what I was investigating.

If we generalize the Delannoy numbers and call any recurrence relation built out of a sum referring to cells at most one square away (in any number of dimensions) as ""Delannoy-like,"" then [this result of Pan's](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012365X0400322X) tells us that the nonzero residues of any such function modulo a prime *p* produce a self-similar fractal akin to the Sierpinski triangle or carpet.  This is true in any number of dimensions and for any integer coefficients.  In effect, the values in a *p* × *p* × ... × *p* area near the origin function as a kind of blueprint for how the pattern reproduces itself at larger and larger scales.  Pan proved this using generating functions while I approached it from a combinatoric perspective.  (I called these types of recurrence relations ""path-counting functions"" since they count lattice paths.)

If we use powers of primes as moduli we produce patterns that are not strictly self-similar but which still possess fractal-like properties.  They have extra features that appear at each new scale.  (More on this later in the gallery.)  Interestingly, [Gamelin and Mnatsakanian
](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/39676484_Arithmetic_based_fractals_associated_with_Pascal's_triangle) proved that the Hausdorff dimension of the resulting patterns (""viewed from infinity"" again) have the exact same Hausdorff dimension as the simpler, self-similar patterns modulo the first-power prime.

As for more complex recurrence relations with cell-references of distances of 2 or more, well, they're less understood.  Sometimes connections to things like cellular automata appear in unanticipated ways, but there appears to be no unified theory.

So [here is a link](https://imgur.com/a/o0fQwDX) to a small gallery showing patterns of nonzero residues.  Nonzero residues are black pixels, zero residues are white pixels.

The first seven pictures are related to Pascal's triangle: [modulo 2](https://i.imgur.com/uEF5AXh.png) (aka the Sierpinski triangle), [modulo 4](https://i.imgur.com/c8ZDnpU.png), [modulo 8](https://i.imgur.com/iCMuMtd.png), [modulo 16](https://i.imgur.com/TbqEWVT.png), [modulo 3](https://i.imgur.com/jjli2HD.png), [modulo 5](https://i.imgur.com/nddnJAS.png), [modulo 997](https://i.imgur.com/Dw1VaPD.png).  The prime patterns are easier to describe: triangles, then triangles of triangles, etc.  The powers of 2 show a richer range of phenomena.  If you're curious to dig more into this, there are a series of papers by Marta Sved discussing this, oftentimes with delightful titles such as ""Divisibility—with visibility"" or ""King's walk on the infinite chessboard.""

The next picture shows the arrangement of the nonzero residues of [the Delannoy numbers modulo 3](https://i.imgur.com/OMaKmOs.png), i.e., the Sierpinski carpet.  If you're curious about this connection, Marko Razpet has written a series of papers discussing this.  There is a fascinating ""dotted cross"" pattern that arises in the ""blueprint"" (as I called it above) visible for all odd primes that he has explained.

The rest of the photos display fascinating behavior in more complex recurrence relations.  [This pattern](https://i.imgur.com/vqWZLSq.png) also arises in the behavior of a cellular automaton called ""Fredkin's replicator,"" a connection I found by matching [a sequence in the OEIS](https://oeis.org/A160239).  Of course, the values of any grid-based recurrence relation modulo a modulus M can be thought of as a kind of cellular automaton with no feedback loops; likewise, a cellular automaton can be thought of as a kind of recurrence relation with an additional dimension encoding time.  But the connection here seems more direct and surprising.

Okay, finally, here's the Python program.  This is a Python 3 program that requires the PIL (Pillow) and numpy libraries for image generation.  I used this program and several variations (colored residues, 2D slices of 3D patterns) to generate a lot of images for my thesis.

The captions of all the pictures in the gallery can be entered as arguments to the following function to recreate those images.  (Those captions are also their filenames.)

Have fun!

For example, I receive the number 10, separately, the number 50, and also another number 90210. I can only receive this data as a vibration, and the vibration cannot arbitrarily increase its frequency. So for example, even though it could vibrate at 10 or 50, it cannot vibrate at 90210.

The last, large number would then have to be represented in a different manner. What would that manner be? The system is to mirror something that is real-world possible, so the style of the function needs to be constrained to what would be usual (e.g an overlay of frequencies), and not something purely theoretical.

If a Fourier series is for functions f:R^n-&gt;R then how do you turn a picture into a function? I guess you could map a graph of a function to a parametric curve but doing Fourier series of a 2-D picture drawn as a curve? I guess implicit function theorem can turn it into a graph which you can Fourier expand but that's only going to help if you have a nice formula, not a bunch of points on a computer.",math

,,UIUC MS vs UW-Madison MA-FAS,RongSong,1617205417,"Hi everyone, 

I have admitted into two programs: [UIUC MS](https://math.illinois.edu/academics/graduate-program-mathematics) and [UW-Madison MA-FAS](https://www.math.wisc.edu/graduate_foundations_advanced_studies), but I have trouble making my decision between them. I actually prefer UW-Madison MA-FAS since I am more familiar with the department, like course structure. Besides, I can transfer 6 credits from my undergrad studies. I plan to spend two years finishing the program. Along the way, I hope to pass the qual exam in geometry/algebra after my first year and find my specific area during the second year. For a thesis, I am not sure about it. If I am prepared enough, i.e. passing the qual exam and doing enough reading in my interested area, I will be glad to do a thesis. Otherwise, I think it might be not very meaningful to do a thesis. How do you guys think? Appreciate your suggestions in advance!

My Background:

I am a senior undergrad majoring in pure math and cs at UW-Madison right now. I am planning to pursue a Ph.D. degree and a tenure track in Mathematics. I am currently interested in hyperbolic geometry and geometric group theory. I fail to be admitted to any Ph.D. programs mostly since I move my main area from computer science to pure mathematics starting my senior year i.e. taking undergrad-level series real analysis/ abstract algebra/ topology for two semesters",math

By ""one thing"" i mean paragraph 3 from this article:

[https://colinraffel.com/blog/gans-and-divergence-minimization.html](https://colinraffel.com/blog/gans-and-divergence-minimization.html)

Concretely, this fragment:

&gt;The first term −E*x*∼*qθ*\[log*qθ*(*x*)\] is simply the entropy of *qθ*(*x*).   
&gt;  
&gt;So, we want our model to have high entropy, or to put it intuitively, its probability mass should be as spread out as possible.   
&gt;  
&gt;The second term E*x*∼*qθ*\[log*p*(*x*)\] is the log probability of samples from *qθ*(*x*) under the true distribution *p*(*x*).   
&gt;  
&gt;In other words, any sample from *qθ*(*x*)  has to be reasonably “realistic” according to our true distribution. Note that without the first term, our model could “cheat” by simply  assigning all of its probability mass to a single sample which has high  probability under *p*(*x*).

How he concluded, that when we maximizing this:

\\argmax*θ*−E*x*∼*qθ*\[log*qθ*(*x*)\]+E*x*∼*qθ*\[log*p*(*x*)\]

we want our model have high entropy?

Also what he meant by:

&gt;any sample from *qθ*(*x*)  has to be reasonably “realistic”

,,Frustration with helping fellow classmates,SnooMaps9943,1617130179,"This might turn into a little bit of a rant...

Some background: I am not good at math. Math was the subject I dreaded in middle and high school because it was the only time I ever felt stupid, and feeling stupid really brought my ego to it’s proverbial knees. But it’s completely objective (not really influenced by political extremism or controverting opinions), and it’s cool to think that these invisible laws and patterns exist all around us, and it makes me feel good when I work really hard and successfully learn about them and how we can use them to solve problems, and the best math teachers I’ve had over the years said they were also bad at math and that’s why they were good at explaining it... So when I decided I wanted to be a teacher, math is the subject I chose to study and eventually teach. It’s much easier to learn when you’ve gained an appreciation for the subject and you don’t feel like you’re being judged by your peers and you’re not concerned with keeping up appearances of being one of the smart kids, you know? I have no regrets with this decision so far.

I’m also a reservist in the military, which requires serving two consecutive weeks during the summer time each year. Last summer I thought I could get away with doing a 6 week long pre-calc course which coincided with what turned out to be and *exhausting* and highly stressful 2 week service obligation. I half-assed-and-passed the class, but when I tried to take the next courses I need for my degree, I realized I didn’t understand the pre-calc topics well enough to advance. So I dropped them, and I’m retaking pre-calc this semester. It’s the only class I’m taking currently because I’m due to give birth in May, and I didn’t want to be too stressed out during the pregnancy and trying to work in finals around my due date or god forbid, take them while I’m sleep deprived and learning to care for a newborn...

Anyway, I have lots of time on my hands right now, and the course seems much easier this time around, so I have been making an effort to help out my classmates. We have this group chat, which I feel like is such a great resource and a good opportunity to get to know one another. I love answering their questions, explaining the concepts I understand, giving out tips to help remember things, and looking through people’s work to point out where they went wrong. It helps me study, I think. (My favorite saying has become “To teach is to learn twice.”) 

However, there are some members of the group who seem to not be really trying to learn and understand the processes and concepts; they just ask for the answers, and questions like “do I really need to watch this video lesson” and “do we really need to show our work for this upcoming exam” and “are we doing anything in class because I’m hung over and might not go.” A couple of them have even had the audacity to ask for the answers to entire assignments at a time, because they’re picking up someone’s shift at work or they just procrastinated and won’t finish on time or whatever bad excuse they come up with. And someone will inevitably give them the answers !!! 

It’s really frustrating to me because A) if our professor gained access to that group and saw that, she would have a case for cheating/academic dishonesty, which can get us kicked out of the university at worst or suspended at best, B) I feel like they’re making the same mistake I did last summer with half-assing the course. Like this isn’t just a class to meet a basic degree requirement; this is “pre-calc for scientists and engineers,” meaning that they will most likely need to take courses that build on the math we’re doing now in order for them to become *scientists* and freakin’ *engineers* (or god forbid, math teachers) who someday will be trusted with important jobs. And C) we’re paying thousands of dollars for these courses and it feels like people are just taking that privilege for granted and flushing their opportunity for a genuine and valuable education down the toilet. Don’t they know how many people would kill to go to school here, but can’t for financial reasons?!

And I’m trying to be mindful of the distinction between students who just genuinely struggle with math (like me), and those who don’t bother with the explanations given to them or attempt to help themselves with the available resources. Like there’s one girl who is struggling a bit because I think she’s a little rusty with the basics, but she’ll always send her work from her attempts and ask what she did wrong, and she comes to the group study sessions I host. I often feel like we make breakthroughs, and it just makes me so happy every time...This other chick, on the other hand, asks for answers a lot, and I’ll take the time to write out explanations of how to do the problems that indirectly give her the answers (as opposed to just a screenshot of the answer, like others share), and I know she doesn’t read them because she’ll ask the group for them repeatedly until someone just gives them to her outright. She never attends the study group. Today she actually asked someone to walk her through a problem since she didn’t know where to start, but it’s the kind that we’ve been doing for weeks now and that we’ll be heavily building on later in the course. I’m reluctant to try to help her specifically at this point, and I know she’s f***ed on this upcoming exam, but I have a lot of mixed feelings about it. On one hand, I don’t feel like she “deserves” help anymore because of her historical lack of effort, and on the other, I feel guilty for giving up on her when there’s a possibility of her starting to try and really learn. (Also some social awkwardness of very obviously ignoring one specific person in the group while I answer other people which makes me uncomfortable.)

I think about what I would do if I was her teacher, and obviously the answer is that I’d like to think I’d never give up on a student. But I would also expect students to ask for help in a certain way and like, attend tutoring if they really need it and stuff, too. Gonna sound like a total mom lecturing here, but I feel like maybe some kids need to fail every once in a while to get that life experience and motivation to like, learn how to learn, like I did...? Idk, I’m just conflicted and frustrated, you know?

Our online HW is pretty straightforward if you do all the problems in the textbook. The problem is that our exams, in class and take home, have absolutely nothing to do with the textbook problems or the online problems. I go to a top15 school and I thought it was just my university difficulty. Oh boy was I wrong. In an effort to study harder I studied using MIT, Carnegie Mellon, Harvard and CalTech resources and did extremely well on their exams. I thought I was prepared for the next exam but I still didn't know how to approach the problems. 

We have an in class exam as well as a take home exam. The last take home exam we had was given 2 weeks in advance and I was barely able to finish it, and I didn't even know what my grade is yet. Apparently everyone has the same problems as I do, and some only were only able to finish 1/5 questions on our take home exams.   


Are there any resources, websites or books, that really delve deep into the proofs and theorems behind calculus III, or calculus in general? After looking a bit online, I heard about Calculus with Analytic Geometry by Anton Howard, but even that doesn't go as in depth as my professor does. I feel lost and I'm sure everyone in my class does as well. For reference, he's during his postdoc at my university and just finished his PhD in Mathematics from Columbia.

We have not covered proofs in our class, but our take home exams are pretty much all proofs, and I am completely lost on how to approach these problems. Looking at Khan Academy or any other online resources can't really help because they don't go deep enough into the derivations of what is going on behind the math. I feel completely lost, not with the computations behind the math, but because I have no resources to approach these types problems.",math

,,Author order matters.... prove me wrong,AcademicOverAnalysis,1617109488,"My training as a mathematician was in pure mathematics, where publications come slowly. I published the three papers that resulted from my dissertation a year or so after I graduated. Subsequently, I had started a postdoctoral position in engineering, where publications are submitted at a rapid pace and there are deadlines to meet for conferences. Thus, by the time I became a professor, while my academic training was in mathematics, I had come up in a rapid fire culture of publication in engineering and computer science.

This results in a bit of a culture clash when I publish with other mathematicians, where they insist on alphabetical order of authors, but I insist on the main contributor being the first author, no matter where we publish. i especially insist on this when it concerns a paper by one of my graduate students. Papers are invariably referred to by the author in first position, even in the case of alphabetical authors. I want my students to get the credit for their work, even if their name is Zhang or Zhu.

I feel that alphabetical order is a throwback to mid 20th century customs, where collaborative papers in pure mathematics were strongly discouraged. Some would say that writing a collaborative paper was like writing none at all, because you couldn’t be sure who did what. I see alphabetical order as the result of the community resisting giving individual credit for multi authored papers.

,,Routh Table First Column 0: Number of non-LHP poles,superman65456,1617083270,"Hi,

I was doing some research and found that when a first column 0 appears but everything else is not necessarily 0 in the row, then there exists poles with nonnegative real parts (or positive real parts if there are no imaginary roots or “opposite” roots in general). From what I saw, the proof mentions the *existence* of non-LHP poles, but doesn’t provide proof of **number** of non-LHP poles based on the first column 0 (actually, I saw one, but it doesn’t give a *hard* proof).

Based on my observations, if a first zero appears in row s^m, at least 2 Routh rows can be skipped including s^m, depending on how many consecutive zeros appear after the first zero. For example, if there’s a nonzero value after the first zero, then we go to s^(m-2) and consider the sign change between s^(m+1) and s^(m-2). Likewise, if there are two consecutive zeros including the first row zero, then we consider the sign change between s^(m+1) and s^(m-4) (the rows in between are skipped). We see that the total number of rows skipped due to the first column zeros is an even number. Is there a way to prove that there is a relationship between the number of skipped rows and the number of non-LHP poles (or non-RHP poles if there aren’t any imaginary poles)?",math

I am interested in studying mathematics and I am looking for mentorship. In 2020 I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. As a result, I dropped out of Columbia University after a year of studies. I am currently receiving treatment and I hope to transfer to a state university in the fall.

From university, I have studied up to multivariable calculus and linear algebra. In my free time, I have been self-studying a bit, just a few problems here and there. I have been learning some intro to proofs as I would like to break into theoretical math.

I think what I need help with is becoming an emotionally mature mathematician. At school I often isolated myself when I studied. I was afraid of opening up to people. Since I have been away from classes I have had time to reflect. I realized that I have made it as for as I can on my own, and I don't want to spend the rest of my life in intellectual isolation. I want to be able to ask for help, work in a community of my peers, and teach others what I know.

So I am looking for mentorship, guidance and community, and I thought I'd drop a line here. Feel free to DM me or leave a comment. Much appreciated!

,,When should you join the main road?,IWillNotShare,1617049089,"The title seems stupid, I know, but I didn't know what else to type. I am just a highschooler eager to learn today so go easy on me. 

I started wondering about something when my german teacher told me I would do a verbal exam next time we have his class. So I prepared. But he said we can't do it today so we would do it the next time. I was a bit confused and relieved, to be honest, because I got more time to prepare even more. The day came and same thing again. Again and again and again, each time telling me I'd do it next time.

The thing is, I will have to do the exam sooner or later (alright, there is a small chance he'd just give me a B be done with it). So, my intuition tells me that every next time the probability of me actually needing to do the exam is higher (until it is 100% on the last day, but never mind that). But then again, he is showing inconsistency and each class, we are doing exactly the things we would do if there never was any exam. So as the time goes on, you learn that he doesn't do the exam that often. (dumb analogy coming up, but imagine a desert. If you spent a day there, you wouldn't have a clue whether it would rain the next day or not, but if you spent a year there, you would know it isn't likely).

So what is it? Am I looking at this the wrong way?

Same thing applies to joining a road. Say you're getting out of your driveway and stop at the edge of the street to see any oncoming traffic. If you stand there for a short time, my intuition tells me there is a smaller chance you would get hit since if some amount of cars pass the road in any given time, less cars would pass in a shorter time. *But* then again, if you wait there longer and see there isn't much traffic, that would show that a car is less likely to pass by the next moment. Again, what is it?

Is this just about what the person in the problem knows or doesn't know? Like, the road would have cars pass by at some constant rate, and the teacher would do exams at some constant rate, but the person just doesn't know? Even so, from the person's perspective, when should they bet the chances are on their side, when should they get on the road and when should they really prepare for the exam (as opposed to studying every time, which isn't optimal). Is this like about calculating the probability of probabilities? Does the question even make sense?

The ability to look at things in different, yet, constructed ways is the greatest joy I have ever acquired through my learning of maths. 

I’m not saying that one can’t achieve such by studying other subjects. But this is just my idea. For instance, last time when I was learning about a finance related test (which by itself is heavily related to math as you might guess), i was able to reconstruct most of the idea using my own graphical sense/understanding to help me to really get the idea without memorizing mouthful words. And I found myself extremely happy about the process of understanding some new things.

It is also sad for me sometimes to think that I have no friends who I can talk about math to, even I’m nota expert on the subject, but just by the simplest hobbyist. Trying to not to boring the conversation is hard (guess that have to do with my communicative skills as well but anyway).

[Animation of \(x2\^a\) of the final equation below \(just so it looks nice, you know\) ](https://i.redd.it/q80sl09uuvp61.gif)

Last week  /u/Reubenwizard posted a function where `pi` unexpectedly appears in the limit.

The function:

[The function](https://preview.redd.it/49six3cdgvp61.png?width=248&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=68b6a018f69232b54f0b13b1d841cd57089ab54a)

A little cleaning, a little massaging (shifting the function by `x := x + 1` and applying the definition of factorial) gets it into this form:

&amp;#x200B;

Since we only care about this function in the limit, we can ignore the constant terms (and reduce) and end up with:

Many of you were right when mentioning it looked like a consequence of Stirling's approximation. The proof of Stirling's approximation is very digestible: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stirling%27s\_approximation#An\_alternative\_derivation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stirling%27s_approximation#An_alternative_derivation)

We can use a common form of the approximation as follows.

I'm sure to many of you, this is trivial- but seeing `pi` pop up in places I least expect it is always a joy (at least to me).

I'm messing around with my own prototype card game and obviously, questions about probability arise from that. I'm not great at math, but I've figured out most questions I had. The following though, I can't solve. Does anyone know the answer to it?

There is a card set of 51 different cards. 14x 1 star, 12x 2 stars, 9x 3 stars, 8x 4 stars, 4x 5 stars and 4x 6 stars.
If you open a pack, you get 10 cards, with the following rarity rates:
Cards 1 - 4 are all 1 star
Cards 5 - 7 are all 2 stars
Cards 8 and 9 are 3 stars
Card 10 has an 80% chance to be a 4 star, a 15% chance to be a 5 star and a 5% chance to be a 6 star.

The question is: how many packs would on average need to be opened to get the full set of 51 cards?

I understand it can be simplified to just card 10, but I wanted to have the context here. So 1 in 20 packs is the average of pulling one 6 star, since it's a 5% chance right?

After that I get stuck. Simply saying 80 seems odd and does not account for duplicates. I discussed it with someone who said a rough estimate would be that since there's 4 6-stars, perhaps it's 4+80=320. But that's an estimate and not an average.

,,Definitions of the coefficients of a quadratic function.,WoofAndGoodbye,1617002057,"So it's not much but for a while now I have been working on defining the coefficients of x in a quadratic equation as an extracurricular activity and just finalised the maths. Is my maths correct? (I am in Year 10 or a Freshman for my Americans out there)

So in most quadratic equations, the basic layout is ax^(2)\+bx+c. My goal is to define a, b and c in terms of the quadratic's peak and the y axis intersection. 

y axis intersection = i

Quadratic peak = {f, g}

So it is immediately obvious that c is equal to i. That is simple. However, a and b are much harder to work out. I got these. 

f=-b/2a

g=-(b/2a)^(2)\+i

c=i

After a long day of calculating I got this beauty.

In any quadratic curve mapped on a graph, the generating formula is as follows.

ax^(2)\+bx+c = -(g-i)/f^(2) \* x^(2) \+ 2(g-i)/f \* x + i.

Is my maths correct?

It’s vaguely like Scrabble, in that you make words from letters worth various points, so spelling EAST would get you 10 points but JAZZ would get you 43. 

We figure if you score over 300 you’ve done well. That happens around 5-10% of the time. Most of those are under 310. For years our highest hand was 333, and second highest 325 - scoring over 320 is very rare, maybe ten-twenty games in total of the 5000?

But then recently we had a 367, which is just miles from any of the other results. That got me wondering  what the odds against such a result were, and it took me only a moment to realise I didn’t have the slightest idea how to work that out. 

Any ideas? There are other aspects to the scoring, like potential 10 point bonuses (two in each of the 8 hands of the game, but one is for most words and the other for longest word, so it’s usually pretty difficult to get both).

This isn't so much 'homework' as real life - and real sleep. Currently, I'm on what is called 'swing shift', which gives me a 11 hour variance between shift start times every single week. It is very rough.

The hope is that someone, somewhere, can look at our current shift design and propose something that would:

1) Keep the start times as close to the same as possible;

2) Be between 40 and 44 hours a week (or 80 to 88 every two weeks and so on);

3) Possibly be designed around a one, two, or four week rotating design;

4) Gives each person at least 2 days off per week;

5) Keeps the supervisor (""A"") at the same start time!

Our shift days are strangely offset, in that they start at 2300 (11 PM) instead of 2400/0000 hours (12 midnight).

Ideally, I'd like to be able to show this to my manager/boss as an improvement on the current design.

So, if you wanted to calculate the sum of all number from 5 to 15, you use this:
(First number + last number) * ((last number - first number +1)/2)
Or in words: (first number + last number) * (amount of numbers / 2)

Now, instead of connecting the edges that way, you pull them out and away from the center before having them meet at the cylinder's midline. Now you have a blue torus with a yellow band along the outer circumference.

Finally, you form the torus by tucking the edges down into the cylinder and joining them at the midline. This time, you end up with a red torus with a yellow band along the inner circumference.

I have a polygon that's positioned on the earth. For each point, I have:

The latitude in degrees (x) The longitude in degrees (y) The altitude above sea level in meters.

An example of one of my points is  { x: 144.99533074458003, y: -32.39730248504104, z: 263.24070871460185 }

Now, in my application, a user draws a polygon in space, and I need to determine the area of that polygon. The user could draw a polygon around a door, or a roof maybe. Sometimes even a sidewalk.

Once the user is done, I have a list of all the points they selected.

An example could be this:

    DOOR = [   { x: 144.99533074458003, y: -32.39730248504104, z: 263.24070871460185 }, // First point, bottom left   { x: 144.99533197184215, y: -32.39730172327194, z: 267.1472276731874 }, // Top left   { x: 144.99534689346532, y: -32.39726245542652, z: 267.04165748822226 }, // Top right   { x: 144.99534752390096, y: -32.39726407569114, z: 263.24884951333394 }, // Bottom right   { x: 144.99533074458003, y: -32.39730248504104, z: 263.24070871460185 }, // Last point, same as first to close the loop. ]; 

The issue now, is that I need to figure out the approximate area between all these points. I know that the polygon won't be perfectly flat, but I can even it out if needed to give an approximation.

**My current strategy is as follows:**

* Find the distance between each of the points using the [Haversine Formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula#:%7E:text=The%20haversine%20formula%20determines%20the,and%20angles%20of%20spherical%20triangles.).
* Determine the height difference between the two points by subtracting z2  
 from z1  
.
* Find the actual length of the line using Pythagorus.
* Get the angle of the line relative to the horizontal plane using (Math.atan2(end.y - start.y, end.x - start.x) \* 180) / Math.PI  
 (Please excuse the Javascript, that's what I'm working in).
* I then have a list of all the lengths and the angles of each line.
* I then convert each angle to Radians.
* Then I generate x and y values like this:  
  endX = start.x + length \* Math.cos(angle)   endY = start.y + length \* Math.sin(angle) 
* This give me a list of the X.Y values of the points.
* I then calculate the area using [this formula](https://www.mathopenref.com/coordpolygonarea.html)

This strategy works when my plane is nearly horizontal, but as soon as I try use it on a vertical surface, I get incorrect results.

I guess there's a few questions here, and any help will be greatly appreciated.

,,Question about Infinity,TheRetroMan_,1615962704,"Let's say there is an athelete who can jump about 1m average and he was able to make one 2m jump at some point. So let's say his possible jump height range is 1m~2m.
He gets lucky today, he was able to make another 2m jump. Jumped 1m, 1.2, 1.6, 2m. And he tries to do 2.1m jump and fails.
Let's have a look at that last try again. He was able to make 2m, but not 2.1m.
Here goes my question. If he couldnt make 2.1m jump, it indicates that at some point between 2 and 2.1m, there is a limit to him. And let's say the limit is 2.05m. If he is able to make 2.05m, wouldn't he be able to make 2.050000000...1m jump? It makes no sense that a person can't jump that tedny tiny gap more. Let's say he makes it. It gets repeated, and at some point he jumps 2.1m. But this doesn't make any sense since 1) I theoretically set the limit 2.05m.
2) if this gets repeated this way constantly, he us able to make unlimited jump.
But, it physically doesn't make any sense that a person can't jump 0.000000000...1m higher. If his limit was 2.05, then he is able to make 2.0499999999999999999...meter jump but not 2.05?

You should be able to jump that little higher, it would be really werid if he was unable to make the 2.000000000000...1m jump while he can do 2m jump.

If he is not able to make lets say 2.3meter jump, REAL MAX, then he was able to jump 2.99999999...meter jump but not 2.3 and it is very weird.

To simplify, lets conservatively say that there’s a 1 in a thousand chance anyone will get a blood clot in a year’s time.

To quote the preface:

&gt;This project grew out of conversations with students about the difficulties inherent in the study of mathematics  ... Math should be difficult, as should any worthwhile endeavor. But it should not be crippling. The ability to succeed in a mathematical program should not be hindered by a person’s gender, race, sexuality, upbringing, culture, socio-economic status, educational  background, or any other attribute.  
&gt;  
&gt;... As you read this, we hope that you will find some inspiration and common ground in these pages. We trust that there is at least one story here that you can connect with. For those stories that you cannot relate to, we hope that you will come to better appreciate the diversity of our mathematical community and the challenges that others have faced. We also hope that you will laugh with some of our authors as they recount some of the more absurd struggles they have faced. In the end, we hope that you are motivated to share your own stories as you learn more about the experiences of the people in your own mathematical lives.

We will read and discuss individual essays from **Part IV: What Do I Do Now? What Happens Next?**

&gt; As advisors of students in college, the editors frequently come across students who ask “What can you do with a degree in mathematics?’’ This is
really hard to answer, because, in a way, “anything’’ is not too far from the
truth. At its very core, studying mathematics helps students become better at
critical thinking and problem solving, two skills that are essential in today’s
world. Since the editors of this book are all professors ourselves, it can be
daunting to talk to students about the so-called real world and what jobs are
really out there.

&gt; Students struggle with finding themselves as a mathematicians and what
to do after they graduate; here are some stories from people who felt that
struggle and resolved that conflict in various ways.

The essays can be [found here](http://www.ams.org/about-us/LivingProof.pdf).

,,Formula to calculate logarithmic curve in the context of IT-security,samuelgfeller,1615894292,"I'm actually a dev, but I think this question fits here as its about maths. I'm implementing a site wide throttle on too many failed requests as protection against distributed brute force attacks.

The question I am stuck with is, after how many failed login requests should I start to throttle?

Now one reasonable way is, as mentioned [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/477578/9013718) ""using a running average of your site's bad-login frequency as the basis for an upper limit"". If the site has an average of 100 failed logins, 300 (puffer added) might be a good threshold.

Now I don't have a running average and I don't want someone having to actively increase the upper limit as the user base grows. I want a dynamic formula that calculates this limit based on the active users amount.

The difficulty is that if there are only a few users, they should have a much higher user to threshold ratio than let's say 100k users. Meaning that for example for 50 users the limit could be set at 50% of the total user count which means allowing 25 failed login requests site-wide in a given timespan. But this ratio should decrease for 100k users, the threshold should be more like around 1%. 1000 failed login requests in the same let's say hour, is a lot (probably not accurate at all I am not a security expert, the numbers are only examples to illustrate).

I was wondering, is there any mathematical formula that could archive this in a neat way?

This is a chart of what I think the formula should be calculating approximately:   
[**Chart with the curve and active users**](https://i.stack.imgur.com/EYgXq.png)

Here is what I have now (I know it's terrible, any suggestion will be better I'm sure):

    $threshold = 1;
    if ($activeUsers &lt;= 50) {
        // Global limit is the same as the total of each users individual limit
        $threshold *= $activeUsers; // If user limit is 4, global threshold will be 4 * user amount
    } elseif ($activeUsers &lt;= 200) {
        // Global requests allows each user to make half of the individual limit simultaneously
        // over the last defined timespan
        $threshold = $threshold * $activeUsers / 2;
    } elseif ($activeUsers &lt;= 600) {
        $threshold = $threshold * $activeUsers / 2.5;
    } elseif ($activeUsers &lt;= 1000) {
        $threshold = $threshold * $activeUsers / 3.5;
    } else { // More than 1000

A rectified sine is purely even harmonics.

If our transformation function is odd like tanh(x)

passing in a square wave (odd harmonics) gives another square wave (odd harmonics)

passing in a saw (odd and even harmonics) adds odd harmonics

passing in a triangle (odd harmonics) adds odd harmonics

What I'm wondering is this: Is there a general rule based on the harmonic content of the original wave and the symmetry of the transformation function that tells you something about the harmonics of the outputted wave?

I'm also wondering how this applies to complex asymmetric waves and transformation functions 


*I've been racking my mind trying to find an answer to this and here's some thoughts that might be useful:* 

If a waveform is asymmetric or has a DC offset (a vertical shift), the bottom and top will transform differently and will add even and odd harmonics. Even waves (or waves than can be phase shifted INTO even functions), can potentially transform differently without a DC offset

In general, odd transformation curves will create odd harmonics when the waveforms you put in have an odd symmetry (or can be phase shifted to have odd symmetry)",math

Let's start with 2^(2) = 4, which we can write 04.

We then have 22^(2) = 484. The number 48 appears nestled in between the 0 and the 4 already there.

We continue with 222^(2) = 49284. The number 92 appears in between the 4 and the 8 of the 48 that appeared a step earlier. Each new double-digit number will be marked in between brackets:

Then, 2222^(2) = 49\[37\]284.

* 22222^(2) = 493\[81\]7284
* 222222^(2) = 4938\[26\]17284
* etc.

In short, we always have a new double-digit number that appears nestled in between the digits of the previously appeared double-digit number (the sentence is convoluted but I couldn't find a better way to say it).

So (at least in the US), many graduate schools have sent out or are starting to send out offers for Fall 2021 programs, and many prospective graduate students are starting to make their decisions about which graduate school to attend. However, lots of things have changed in response to COVID-19, including virtual visitation events.

---

We have many wonderful volunteers who are dedicating their time to answering your questions.  Their focuses span a wide variety of interesting topics, and we also have a few panelists that can speak to the graduate school process outside of the US.

We also have a handful of volunteers that are postdocs or have recently finished graduate school/postdocs and can speak to what happens after you earn your degree.  We also have some panelists who are now in industry/other non-math fields.

Furthermore, we also have panelists that have taken non-standard paths to math grad school, that are in grad school in related fields (such as computer science), or have taken unique opportunities in grad school!  

---

These panelists have special red flair.  However, if you're a graduate student or if you've received your graduate degree already, feel free to chime in and answer questions as well!  The more perspectives we have, the better!

Again, the panel will be running over the course of the next two weeks, so feel free to continue checking in and asking questions!

Furthermore, one of our former panelists, /u/Darth_Algebra has kindly contributed [this excellent presentation about applying to graduate schools and applying for funding](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1niqlzySV4JZGFFbzVjV1RaOEE/edit?usp=sharing).

With some though, it was hard to have 20 working days in the month without having very long runs of working days at the end. So in these cases, I have left it at 18 or 19.

To try to score the different schedules I numbered each consecutive workday with integers 1,2,3 etc and each day off with negative integers 0, -1 etc then for the score took the total of the values for all the days in the month.

,,Are there symmetry rules for odd and even functions with respect to the arguments?,LemonLimeNinja,1615775129,"I know odd functions are f(x)=-f(-x) and even functions are f(x)=f(-x) leading to the symmetry that multiplying odd functions give an even function and multiplying even functions give an even function, and multiplying an odd and even function gives an odd function.

What I'm wondering about is if there are any symmetry rules for odd/even functions as arguments of other odd/even functions.

For example f(x)=sin(x), and g(x)=arctan(x) are both odd functions. but g(f(x))=arctan(sin(x)) is also an odd function. If we use the even function h(x)=|x|, g(h(x))=arctan(|x|) which is an even function

so odd function as an argument of an odd function is an odd function

even function as an argument of an odd function is an even function

If I look at the other two cases using the same functions above just use |arctan(x)| instead I get:

odd function as an argument of an even function is an even function

even function as an argument of an even function is an even function

does this generalize to any odd and even function. Is there any class of asymmetric functions that when passed into an odd/even function will give another odd or even function",math

In fact this definition most naturally suggests an alternative notation for Calculus:

    df = cos(x) dx

I claim this notation is pragmatically *better* than the alternatives in a number of ways.

First, note that this notation is actually already taught in Calculus, but exclusively for used in integration.  We write an integration problem as ""y = ∫ cos(x) dx"".  If we really want notation that supports the notation that an integral is the inverse of a derivative, then the most natural way to express the derivative of ""sin(x)"" is as ""cos(x) dx"" since this is exactly what we pass into the integral function.

Second, Calculus with several variables becomes more natural.  What is the gradient of x \* y?  Currently your Calculus student will ask you what you want the derivative with respect to because the notation they've learned doesn't naturally generalize to anything but a single variable.  The answer should be easy: ""y dx + x dy"".  Taking derivatives with respect to a particular variable should be seen as a special case (i.e. equivalent to setting dy=0 in the example above).  Instead we *only* teach derivatives with respect to a single variable in Calculus 1-3.  People take 3 Calculus courses without learning what the [Del operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Del) is.

Third, Calculus can be applied to matrices, and the standard notation of ""df/dx"" makes no sense in this context.  For instance, if ""C = A B"" then we can write ""dC = A dB + dA B"" (source: [the best pdf on the Internet](https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~hwolkowi/matrixcookbook.pdf)).

Note that if we write this as ""dC/dB = A"" there is the natural question of *what dC/dB even refers to*.  You're... multiplying dC by the inverse of dB (which need not be square!) and that equals some third matrix?!  Yes, we both know ""dy/dx"" isn't ""really"" a fraction, but then maybe our notation should actually reflect that!  Writing ""dC = A dB + dA B"" makes this immediately clear: dB represents a small change in B and if we want to know what the corresponding small change in C is we can simply multiply dB by A.

Fourth, this approach is more natural for differential equations.

* ""y += cos(x) \* dx"" is literally the line of code you write for Euler's method (also works for more than 1 dimensions)
* The definition for ""linear separable equation"" goes from ""N(y) dy/dx = M(x)"" to the much more elegant ""N(y) dy = M(x) dx"".  It's instructive to look at the venerable Paul Dawkin's [notes](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/DE/Separable.aspx), where he has to jump through some hoops to take his reader from the bad definition to the good one.  Note also that the first thing he does is integrate with respect to x, which involves magically adding a ""dx"" to both sides of the equation to make it integral-friendly .  This incantation can be omitted if one could simply start with the natural definition for ""separable"".

In short: the notation used for matrix calculus is intuitive, flows naturally from (one) definition of the derivative, is currently already used when teaching integration.  It should become the de facto notation.",math

,,What is the geometric interpretation of dy/dx for the folium of Descartes?,Lafrenchmen,1615753247,"So I was working through some problem sets from Pollard and Tenenbaum's text on ODEs and ran into an interesting problem. It was the only problem that I scratched my head over, and oddly enough, it was the only problem where the answer wasn't given. The problem is stated as follows:

If x^(3) \+ y^(3) \-3xy = 0,

then... (by implicit differentiation)

3x^(2) \+ 3y^(2) (dy/dx) - 3x(dy/dx) - 3y = 0

therefore...

dy/dx = (y - x^(2) )/(y^(2) \- x),     For  y^(2)  **≠**  x

Explain by the use of its graph what this means geometrically.

&amp;#x200B;

The geometric meaning that I initially derived is that the tangent to the curve is ""infinitely"" steep, and thus parallel to the y-axis, at points where y^(2) = x. Conversely, the tangent has zero slope, and thus parallel to the x-axis, at points where x^(2) = y.

Suspecting that there is probably higher hanging fruit to be plucked, I thought I'd ask around the math community and get some other opinions. What other geometric significance can you derive here?",math

(Euler's pentagonal formula)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJ8pnCO0nTY) The explanatory video by Mathologer, and I learn't a lot. Near the end somewhere the presenter just throws in that a small modification to his sequence of sequences can be used to generate primes.

I created the Rosetta Code task, and [Python entry](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Partition_function_P#Python:_Mathloger) that follows the video, going so far as to add the prime number generator too. But I was used to sieves for generating primes and I could not work out how this new method worked.

*I still have a mental todo item to get back to this.*

Another mental todo item was that I remembered from this, or probably another mathologer video where he pointed out that two sequences can lull you into thinking they are the same for several values before they then diverge. I needed to check the partition based prime generator against a sieve.

Well, this morning I added the following extra code to use Pythons [sympy.primerange](https://docs.sympy.org/latest/modules/ntheory.html?highlight=primerange) sieve and checked the first 100\_000 primes:

&amp;#x200B;

    if 1:
        from sympy import primerange
        
        n = 100_000
        print('Check that the first', n, 'partition and sieved primes are equal:')
        part_primes = list(islice(par_primes(), n))
        sieve_primes = list(primerange(2, part_primes[-1]+1))
        if part_primes == sieve_primes:

        else:
            print(f""  First {n} primes are NOT equal!"")

Outputs:

    Check that the first 100000 partition and sieved primes are equal:
      First 100000 primes, up to 1299709 are equal.

Is there a terminology/research available for something i can best describe as boolean space entropy?

,,Number of regions created by all pairwise bisecting hyperplanes between n points,lucasvb,1615634067,"Let {Pi} be n distinct points in a d-dimensional Euclidean space. For every pair (Pi,Pj) with i≠j, we can construct a perpendicular bisecting hyperplane equidistant between the two points, which splits the space into two regions. We can construct n(n−1)/2 such cuts, splitting the region into N pieces.

**Question**: What is the maximum number of regions N(d,n) that can be produced in this way?

This is a similar but more restricted version of the lazy caterer/cake number problem (generalized to higher dimensions), because the pairwise, equidistant perpendicular bisector constraint prevents certain cuts from existing.

* If d=1, we actually do get the lazy caterer's sequence: with n(n−1)/2 cuts we can construct N(1,n)=n(n−1)/2+1 regions.

* If d=2, we have N(2,1)=1 and N(2,2)=2 trivially. For n=3, the three points form a triangle, and by construction the cuts always meet at the triangle's orthocenter, so we get N(2,3)=6, and not 7 regions as in the lazy caterer sequence. This is an example of how this problem differs from most questions I keep finding along these lines. I am almost sure N(2,4)=18 and N(2,5)=46, but I couldn't prove it.

* In general, if I didn't mess it up, it seems N(d,d+1)=(d+1)!, because one can always construct a simplex to generalize the orthocenter idea.

I've been working on this on and off for a few weeks now, but I'm haven't come up with a good argument for the general case. Any pointers? I would have figured this sort of problem would have been solved somewhere at this point, but I my search hasn't come up with anything.

,,A little relationship I noticed between graphs and binary operations,Electronic_Purple_80,1615563218,"Take G, a directed graph, and a function G -&gt; M labeling each vertex with an element of some magma M (a binary operation on a set).

Suppose a vertex labeled A has an edge to a vertex labeled B. Then you are allowed to merge these vertices together into one, with label AB (that is, the product of A times B in the magma M).

Say that M ""fits"" G if any two sequences of merges which lead to the entire graph becoming a single vertex put the same label on that vertex, and if this is also true for any subset of the graph. Say that M ""perfectly fits"" G if it fits G regardless of the labels initially placed on G's vertices. Then it's possible to describe certain important properties of M by the kinds of graphs it fits.

M is commutative, for instance, if and only if it perfectly fits the undirected 2-chain. It's associative if and only if it perfectly fits the directed 3-chain - and both commutative AND associative if it perfectly fits the undirected triangle graph. It's unital if there is a specific element 0 such that, for any graph it fits, you can add a vertex labeled 0 with an undirected edge to any vertex of the graph, and it also fits the result.

,,"Borger’s Absolute Geometry, Anyone?",whisperfiends,1615539402,"A frustrating aspect of scheme theory is that the final object of Sch, Spec Z, has “too much internal structure.” Often (in arithmetic geometry) we work over a base Spec F_p instead (a finite field), which internally is just a point with the obvious function field. There’s a famous analogy between number theory and arithmetic curves—more precisely, between number fields and function fields on arithmetic curves over Spec F_p (complex curves are also part of this “rosetta stone” but we won’t need that here). There’s an analogy of the Riemann hypothesis for arithmetic curves, which of course is much easier to prove. Weil proved this in the 1950s if I’m not mistaken, and then Grothendieck’s etale cohomology and some ingenious work by Deligne extended this to nonsingular projective varieties over finite fields.

For a long time geometers have dreamed about doing geometry over a “deeper base” than Spec Z, namely the hypothetical “field with one element” F1. The idea is that Spec Z would be a kind of arithmetic curve over F1, and number fields would be realized as the function fields of curves over F1. In particular, if the fiber product of Spec Z with itself over Spec F1 made sense and was amenable to some kind of intersection theory, we might imitate Weil and prove the Riemann hypothesis. Of course there is no “field with one element” as such, so this thing would have to lie outside the world of rings/schemes.

Ten years ago or so Borger [developed](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0906.3146.pdf) an approach for thinking about geometry over F1. He interprets the structure of a lambda-ring on a ring R, an endomorphism lifting the Frobenius on R mod p for each p, as descent data for Spec R -&gt; Spec Z to Spec F_1. This induces a geometric morphism of topoi between the gros etale topos of schemes (over Spec Z) and the “gros etale topos over Spec F_1,” which is defined thereby. So this isn’t just a way to look at schemes over F_1, but also all etale sheaves. 

I’m curious, for those who work in this area, what progress has been made in developing Borger’s absolute geometry. Is it promising? How does it compare to other approaches to F1 geometry, like “blue schemes” or multiplicative monoids?

I suppose you could say that Scholze-Fargues’ recent work is very roughly related to this general idea, in that the goal is to describe a problem about number fields (local Langlands) in terms of geometry over a new curve (the “Fargues-Fontaine curve.”)",math

My first semester when I took multivariable calculus, I got off to a rocky start. I did rather poorly in the class until I started skipping all of the main lectures and learning the material instead through MIT OCW and the textbook. It might be fine if it were just that one class. However, I had a similar experience in other math classes. I’ve only had a couple of math professors for whom I’ve been able to learn effectively from their lectures. I was wondering if anyone could relate or provide me with some insight, because it's kinda discouraging. I know people say that you should read the textbook ahead of the actual lecture so that you can follow along, but if I can just read the book to learn the material ahead of time, what’s the point of attending the lecture at all? And don’t say to ask the professor questions. In my experience, the kinds of questions people ask the lecturer are mostly clarification questions. In other words, they eventually would have been able to answer it on their own. If you truly have a question about the material that’s worth asking the professor, I feel like it’s probably a question that would be more appropriate for something like office hours rather than the main lecture.  I have considered the possibility that I'm just not particularly good at math (I typically don't have this problem with CS, which is easier than math).

,,Looking To Pair With A New Mathematician To Draft Type-Set Course Notes,FondleMyFirn,1615482493," 

I think that it's pretty common knowledge that new professors have a lot of stress managing research and their course preparations. So I was thinking there's an opportunity for a mutual partnership in this regard.

I am entering my PhD in September and I wanted to try and develop a bit of money on the side, so I thought what I could do is provide a service for 1-2 mathematicians who would like a rough draft of written course notes to be typeset in LaTeX, but more specifically, in Overleaf. The reason I am particular about mathematicians is that my area of study is heavily mathematical (optimization, differential equations, mathematical ecology) so if I can find someone who needs to teach in this area, there's an added benefit in that I can get some exposure to some of the concepts and material while I work on type-setting the notes over the summer in preparation for September. Additionally, since most of the heavy lifting will be done for you in terms of type-setting, you can then just modify the code (which would be yours) however you like.

In any case, for those who are interested please feel free to shoot me a dm and we can explore this together and figure something out!",math

,,"Anyone else just suddenly had math just ""click"" with them?",FlamingOrange,1615446514,"I remember as a kid in elementary school I used to be horrible at math, for one reason or another I just was absolutely horrible. Around the age 7 I would say, I would get a huge interest in physics and I wanted to be an astrophysicist, without even knowing what it was called, so already as a kid I was already very passionate about being a ""space scientist"" as I called it. I was so bad at math that I would oftentimes cry during math tests because I was the last one trying to finish a math test. I remember I would instead just watch documentaries about astronomy and space and a lot of the math they brought up, like parallax, and Newton's laws of motion made so much more sense to me. I suppose since it was applied in a more ""relatable"" way and a much more interesting way than some teacher ever could. For a long while I would ace the rare science and math tests on those subjects just because I already knew about those topics.   


After a few years of that, about the age of 10-11 I remember finding out what that it was actually called being an Astrophysicist, and that really excited me to no end. After that, everything in the world and math just ""clicked"". I was no longer confused with math and everything just clicked so well. I feel like my entire world literally changed and how I viewed the world morphed into one of math, like trust me, everything has math and physics behind it and when you see it through that lens it really does change how you view the world. Ever since then math was my best subject and I remember sleeping during a math test (like a math SAT) for my school and getting extremely high scores.
